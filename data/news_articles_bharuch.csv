Ahmed Patel’s son Faisal announces exit from Congress,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmed-patels-son-faizal-announces-exit-from-congress,2025-02-14,14,02,2025,"Congress in Gujarat is grappling with a deepening crisis as a string of senior leaders continue to exit, dealing a significant blow to its political standing in the state. In the latest setback, Faisal Patel, a Congress leader from Bharuch, and son of the late Congress stalwart Ahmed Patel, has also announced his departure, further weakening the party’s position. His exit marks yet another high-profile defection to the BJP, intensifying the challenges Congress faces in its efforts to regain ground in Gujarat. Notably, since the time of the Lok Sabha elections, both Faisal Patel and his sister Mumtaz Patel have expressed their dissatisfaction with the party. Congress leader Faisal Patel took to social media platform X to announce his departure. He wrote, With great pain & anguish, I have decided to stop working for @INCIndia. It’s been a tough journey for many, many years.” “My late father Ahmed Patel gave his entire life working for the country, party & the #Gandhi family. I tried following his footsteps but was denied every step of the way. I will continue to work for mankind in any way possible. The congress party will remain my family as it has always been. I want to thank all the congress leaders, party workers and well-wishers who have supported me,” he added. Will Faisal join BJP? It is no longer surprising to see prominent Gujarat leaders joining the BJP. Amid this, speculation is growing that Faisal may soon embrace saffron and appear on the BJP platform. However, given the BJP’s political stance toward the minority community, Faisal’s political career in the party may not flourish, as per experts. It remains to be seen whether he ultimately joins the BJP or takes a different path.",bharuch
