The parents of students of Kalorex Future School were summoned to the office of the district education officer (DEO) on Friday where they admitted fake admissions of their children. These students, studying in Class 1 to 6 will face cancellation of admissions at the end of the year. Every year, schools submit names of suspicious admissions under RTE to DEO. Last year, around 300 fake RTE admissions were witnessed in Ahmedabad. By the end of this year, over 50 students were under the radar of school administration over fake RTE admissions. The RTE provides free education for needy and underprivileged students from classes 1 to 8 in 13 categories, based on merit and income criteria. Many parents were found to be submitting false income certificates to get their children admitted under RTE. To address this issue, the government made it mandatory to attach income tax return proof along with the RTE form two years ago.

On late night on Friday, a group of individuals, allegedly driven by personal enmity, barged into a housing society in Ram Colony, terrorising residents and damaging properties. The police have arrested two suspects, identified as Ranjeet Bharwad and Nirav Bharwad, in connection with the case. Authorities are continuing their investigation into the attack. According to police officials, the conflict stems from an incident that occurred about a month ago, on September 19. Kanu Bharwad, a resident of Vadaj, had lodged a complaint after being assaulted and humiliated by a group of 5-6 individuals from the Sardar community, who also reside in Ram Colony. The altercation marked the beginning of a tense standoff between the Bharwad and Sardar communities. For weeks, tensions simmered beneath the surface as Kanu Bharwad sought revenge for the earlier attack. On Friday, Kanu allegedly gathered a group of 15-20 people from his community and stormed Ram Colony, vandalising vehicles parked in the area. Approximately 15 vehicles, including cars, auto-rickshaws, and two-wheelers, were damaged during the attack. Residents who attempted to intervene were reportedly beaten by the group. The incident was quickly reported to the Vadaj Police Station, but by the time officers arrived, the attackers had fled. A case has been registered, and police are actively investigating the situation. Himanshu Kumar Verma, DCP Zone-1, provided further details, saying, “Over the past month, there has been tension building up, and the vandalism that took place last night was a result of personal enmity between individuals from the two communities. We have already arrested two suspects, and the search for others involved in the crime is ongoing.” Verma also reassured the public that security measures have been strengthened in the area. “We have deployed PCR vans and teams at the site to prevent any further incidents. A special team has been formed to apprehend the remaining culprits,” he added.",ahmedabad
Breast cancer awareness month: Over 54k diagnosed in Gujarat in 5 years,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/breast-cancer-awareness-month-over-54k-diagnosed-in-gujarat-in-5-years,2024-10-19,19,10,2024,"October is recognised as ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’ as the World Health Organisation (WHO) dubs it ‘the most common cancer globally with around 2.3 million new cases every year’. Gujarat is witnessing a concerning rise in cancer cases along with heart disease as over the past five years, approximately 54,616 individuals have been diagnosed with breast cancer. In Gujarat, breast cancer deaths have increased by 25% in the past 10 years, with 3,355 deaths in 2014 compared to 4,280 in 2023. From 2014 to 2023, there have been 38,064 deaths related to breast cancer in Gujarat. Nationwide, the number of women dying from breast cancer increased from 78,387 in 2021 to 80,390 in 2022; and to 82,429 in 2023. Dr Shashank Pandya, Director of the Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI) located within Civil Hospital campus in Asarwa, stated, “Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Even today, most breast cancer cases in India are diagnosed in the last stage, leading to a higher death rate. Early diagnosis and timely treatment can significantly improve survival rates for breast cancer patients.” In a joint initiative by the government and the GCRI has launched a ‘Sanjeevani Rath’ screening van. This van travels across Gujarat to provide free cancer diagnosis services at various locations. The government has also started a special OPD (Outpatient Department) for breast cancer treatment at the Civil Cancer Hospital, where 60-70 patients are registered daily and receive free cancer screening services. Reasons behind increasing breast cancer cases The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Long-term use of hormones like estrogen and progesterone. Late marriages and late childbirth. Absence of breastfeeding. Alcohol, smoking, and obesity. Some breast cancers can be hereditary due to genetic mutations. 5-10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary, highlighting the importance of genetic screening. Steps to reduce breast cancer risk Self-examination of breasts every month after the fifth day of the menstrual cycle. Consulting medical practitioners and getting routine check-ups. Women aged 40 and above should get an annual mammogram (breast X-ray).

SC dismisses Kejriwal’s plea challenging summons in PM Modi’s degree defamation case,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/supreme-court-dismiss-arvind-kejriwal-plea-pm-narendra-modi-degree-defamation-case,2024-10-21,21,10,2024,"Arvind Kejriwal The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea filed by AAP national Convenor and former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal seeking the quashing of the summons order in a criminal defamation case concerning Prime Minister Narendra Modi's academic degree. A bench, headed by Justice Hrishikesh Roy, noted that the top court in April this year had declined to entertain a similar plea filed by AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, who is co-accused in the defamation case. The Bench, also comprising Justice SVN Bhatti, clarified that it has not gone into the merits of the matter and all contentions of the parties are left open to be raised in the course of trial proceedings. In the course of the hearing, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Kejriwal, said that he is ready to express regret for his statement. However, this met strong opposition from Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared on behalf of the Gujarat University. Mehta said that Kejriwal “is in the habit of making reckless statements and then saying sorry”. He further submitted that the Central Information Commission’s decision to furnish a copy of PM Modi’s degree certificate was quashed by the Gujarat High Court. Without examining the contentions raised, the apex court dismissed Kejriwal’s plea in line with its earlier order passed in Sanjay Singh’s matter. The defamation case emanates from derogatory statements made by AAP supremo Kejriwal and his party MP concerning Prime Minister Modi’s academic degree. A metropolitan court in Ahmedabad had summoned both the politicians following a criminal defamation complaint from Gujarat University. In February this year, a bench of Justice Hasmukh D Suthar of the Gujarat High Court found no ground to nullify the summons in a 61-page detailed order. “Whatever grounds urged by the petitioners are disputed questions of fact which may be adjudicated at the full-fledged trial and by recording the evidence as no mini-trial is permissible while exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC,” the bench said.

This is the second time the government has opted for a retired professor as a vice-chancellor. In February, the vice-chancellor position at the university in Gandhinagar became vacant. The government set up a search committee to find a replacement. After the selection process, Dr Saroj Sharma, chairperson of NIOS and a professor from a Delhi university, was appointed on September 5. However, the newly appointed female vice-chancellor at Teachers University was even removed before officially taking charge due to disputes. Although the government revoked Dr Sharma’s appointment, it has now selected retired Professor Ramesh Patel from Maharaja Sayajirao University as the new vice-chancellor. Usually, vice-chancellors serve a five-year term, but Professor Patel is over 63 and will turn 65 in just 15 months, making him ineligible for the role then. This means the government will need to appoint new Vice chancellor again. There’s been a growing conversation in the higher education community about why the government is struggling to find enough qualified professors among the many colleges and universities. Concerns have also been raised about why the names put forward by search committees aren’t being chosen. Right now, four universities in Gujarat—Bhavnagar, Saurashtra, Junagadh, and the Children’s University—have yet to appoint a vice-chancellor.

As a result, vegetable prices are soaring. In many districts of Gujarat, seasonal rainfall has exceeded 100%, and certain areas are still receiving rain, causing damage to the crops. The heavy rains have led to a shortage of vegetables in the market and rise in price. For example, the price of tomatoes has surged to ₹120 per kg, while onions are priced at ₹70, ginger at ₹140, and potatoes at ₹50 per kg. Before the festivities of Diwali, the surge in prices are likely to break the budget for many households. Before this, the cost of veg thali had increased by 11% in the month of July as ingredient prices went up.  However, year-on-year, the cost of a representative home-cooked veg thali declined by 4% in July. A total 7% out of the 11% rise in the cost of the veg thali can be attributed to only tomato prices, which zoomed 55% month-on-month from ₹42 per kg in June to ₹66 per kg in July, and now has crossed the three-figure mark.

Morris Samuel Christian, who faces multiple criminal charges, established an illegal court and tribunal, and 'ruled' on land disputes — including those under the jurisdiction of Ahmedabad district. He charged his clients ₹30 lakh per 'arbitration', as per the police, and named various officials from the government and the Amdavad Municipal Corporation, as the “opposing party”. Karanj police have filed a complaint and launched an investigation. Devious plans The scam came to light when Christian issued an unauthorised arbitration award transferring government land in Paldi (Revenue Survey No. 306, Final Plot 32 of TP Scheme 6) to one Thakor Babuji Chhanaji. To enforce this award, Babuji Thakor filed a civil application in the Sessions Court, showing the Collector as the opposing party. Government advocates Haresh Shah and Vijay Sheth discovered irregularities in the application, and Justice JL Chovatiya declared Christian a bogus arbitrator. The primary investigation revealed that Christian had appointed himself as an arbitrator without government consent in violation of legal procedure. Investigators said that Christian’s fraudulent rulings affected at least 11 properties, with 10 cases still pending. Several government officials, including the collector, had already recorded some of these fraudulent awards in official revenue records. This isn’t Christian’s first brush with the law. Prior charges registered against him at the Maninagar police station include those under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including fraud, forgery, and criminal trespass.

Gujarat HC directs Rajkot sessions court to hear victim’s advocate in Aatkot gang rape case,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-hc-directs-rajkot-sessions-court-to-hear-victims-advocate-in-aatkot-gang-case,2024-10-23,23,10,2024,"Gujarat High Court has ordered the Rajkot Sessions Court to ensure that the advocate of the victim in the Aatkot gang rape case is given a fair and effective hearing during the bail proceedings of the accused. The court also emphasised adherence to the Supreme Court’s ruling in the “Lakhimpur Kheri” case, stressing the victim’s right to be heard at every stage of the criminal process. The case stems from an FIR filed on July 25, 2024, at Aatkot Police Station against Paresh Radadiya and Madhu Tadhani, who are charged under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including gang rape (Section 376D), based on an allegation from a student residing at D B Patel Institutes of Education’s girls’ hostel. The incident involves the alleged assault of a hostel inmate by a trustee and his associate. Following a cursory investigation, the chargesheet was filed on September 16, 2024. Two of the accused have yet to be arrested. During the investigation, both accused remained at large, only surrendering to the police on their own terms. Accused Paresh Radadiya initially sought anticipatory bail, which Sessions Judge Tamakhuwala denied, citing strong prima facie evidence. However, after the chargesheet was filed, the same judge granted Radadiya’s regular bail, despite inconsistencies in the victim’s statements and without properly hearing the victim’s advocate. This led to an appeal in the Gujarat High Court for the cancellation of his bail. Similarly, when the second accused, Madhu Tadhani, applied for bail, the victim’s advocate was again denied an opportunity for oral submissions. The victim’s legal team subsequently approached the Gujarat High Court, arguing that the Sessions Court had failed to uphold the Supreme Court’s guidelines, particularly the ruling in the “Lakhimpur Kheri” case, which mandates the victim’s right to be heard during bail applications. Exercising its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the Gujarat High Court directed the Sessions Court to comply with this directive and ensure the victim's advocate is heard in all future proceedings.

These raids are believed to be part of an investigation into big cash transactions in the construction sector. According to sources in the Income Tax Department, searches were carried out at various properties, including the Nyalakaran Group’s office on Dabhoi-Waghodiya Road, as well as residences and offices of key partners such as Nitin Vadhwana, Bhagyash Patel, Shubhang Brahmbhatt, Hitesh Katharotiya, and Deepak Savaliya. The operation also involved the promoters of the Ratnam Group – Nilesh Sheth, Nisarg Sheth, Sunny Sheth, Chirag Hasmukh Shah, and Anurag Jain – who are currently under scrutiny. Income tax officials have set up investigations at the Ratnam Group’s office on Pradarshan road  in Sama Savli, and have included architects associated with the group in the inquiry. Additionally, the department has been examining other financial entities related to real estate in Vadodara. Raids have also been reported around the highway bypass area of Vadodara against two builder groups, including the Sheth Brothers from the Courtyard Group, known for developing schemes in Goti and Sevasi. During the raids, officials seized computer data and scanned mobile devices belonging to the promoters to extract relevant information. Hard drives are also being confiscated to retrieve data crucial for the investigation. Notably, these builders are not only engaged in real estate but have interests in other businesses, raising further questions about their financial dealings. The Income Tax Department is continuing its investigations to get more details.

The fatal incident took place when a dumper carrying sand collided with a truck transporting drainage pipes. Police suspect that the dumper’s brakes may have failed, causing the vehicle to ram into the truck. Emergency services quickly arrived at the scene, and commuters on the highway were briefly disrupted while the wreckage was cleared. Both vehicles were heavily damaged. The police are currently investigating the accident to confirm whether mechanical failure or driver negligence was the cause of the crash. Further details are expected to be released as the investigation progresses.

"AMC proposes mandatory RFID chipping, tagging for city’s pet dogs, strays",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/amc-proposes-mandatory-rfid-chipping-tagging-for-citys-pet-dogs-strays,2024-10-24,24,10,2024,"Ahmebadad’s dogs – estimated to number about 2 lakh – could soon receive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) microchip implants and visual ear tags. A proposal submitted to the Amdavad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) Standing Committee by the Cattle Nuisance Control Department (CNCD) aims to extend the city’s animal registration programme from cattle to include both stray and pet dogs. BizOrbit Technologies will execute the two-year project, valued at ₹1.80 crore, the proposal states. RFID implants will cost ₹285 per dog, while visual ear tags will cost ₹30 per dog. If passed, the registration mandate would help identify strays and pets along with their owners across the city. “In accordance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023, the department has decided to give identification to all dogs. These, including their owner’s registration,” said CNC head Naresh Rajput. ABC Rules mandate identification tags for sterilised and vaccinated dogs to monitor their well-being and future vaccination needs. The rules prohibit relocation of strays, stating that sterilisation and vaccination are the only legal methods to control their population. The AMC will continue its existing programme of capturing stray dogs for sterilisation procedures, now enhanced with the new identification system once implemented. Microchips Vs Ear Tags Typically, RFID microchips, about the size of a grain of rice, are implanted under the animal’s skin between the shoulder blades. When scanned with a special RFID reader, the chip transmits its unique 15-digit identification number. This number, when looked up in a registered database, provides access to detailed information about the animal and its owner. The chip itself doesn’t store personal data—it only contains this ID number. The chip has no battery and is activated by the scanner’s electromagnetic field, allowing it to last for the animal’s lifetime. Meanwhile, visual ear tags often include a unique visible ID number, colour coding to indicate vaccination status, sterilisation status or area/zone and year of tagging. While more visible than microchips, these tags are vulnerable to damage or loss over time. Also read: Ahmedabad civic body expands sterilisation drive with ₹8cr tender",ahmedabad
Gandhinagar fake ‘judge’ remanded to police custody for 11 days,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/no-bci-affiliation-fake-judge-morris-christian-practised-law-illegally-for-25-30-years,2024-10-24,24,10,2024,"After Karanj police sought 14 days' remand of Morris Samuel Christian, the Gheekanta Metropolitan Court accepted an 11-day remand (till November 3, 11 am) in police custody on Wednesday. The 37-year-old allegedly posed as 'judge' of a fake court made by him in Gandhinagar for six years. Earlier, when presented at the Gheekanta criminal court on October 22, he insisted that he not be called “accused” as he was still a “judge” — even as police made their case against him for running an illegal courtroom. The (real) court heard that Christian, the self-proclaimed arbitrator who “presided” over cases worth crores, is not registered with any state bar council across India. Further, the law degree he does claim to hold is not valid under the Bar Council of India (BCI), according to Anil C Kella, former chairperson of the Gujarat Bar Council, and current chair of its finance committee. Christian, who has allegedly been practising law illegally for the past 25–30 years and been a fake judge for six years, also told the court that the Karanj police had beaten a confession out of him. They accidentally broke his glasses while they kicked and hit him, he said, requesting medical attention. The court transferred Christian to Sabarmati Jail, and directed the police to present his medical report on October 23. Long history of deception In July 2007, Christian had applied for a legal licence with the Bar Council. After verification of his documents in December 2007, it was confirmed that he didn’t qualify. He claimed to have obtained an LLB degree in 2002 from Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan in New Delhi and a B.Com from the same university—an institution not recognised by the Bar Council of India. His claim of membership in the International Bar Council was dismissed by the Gujarat Bar Council, which clarified that such membership does not permit anyone to practise law in Indian courts. Trail of fraudulent cases The scale of Christian’s deception became apparent through multiple fraud complaints. In 2015, he set up a fake arbitration tribunal in Gandhinagar, charging victims like a resident of Ahmedabad’s Drive-In Road area ₹1 lakh for his services. He even forged a circular in the name of the Principal Judge of Gandhinagar, claiming his appointment as an arbitration counsellor for all civil cases under Section 89 of the Civil Procedure Code. His illegal rulings affected more than 100 acres of land, with at least 11 properties involved and 10 cases still pending. He charged clients ₹30 lakh per arbitration, naming various government officials and the Amdavad Municipal Corporation as opposing parties in his fraudulent proceedings. This isn’t Christian’s first encounter with law enforcement. In 2006, he was arrested by the Crime Branch in a fake visa scam, where authorities discovered nine fake passports and forged visas in his possession. The current investigation began when he attempted to transfer government land in Paldi through an unauthorised arbitration award.

The individuals were discovered during a series of operations targeting criminal networks involved in forgery and human trafficking. Legal procedures are currently underway for each detained individual, officials reported. The investigation began with the detection of forged documents being used to secure false identities, leading to the registration of a case against one Faruk Mondal and several others. As part of this crackdown, the crime branch arrested both the primary accused and accomplices who had facilitated the creation of these forged documents. More than 200 suspected forged documents are under examination as part of this probe.

Ahmedabad police under scrutiny for alleged ₹20 lakh fraud,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-police-under-scrutiny-for-alleged-20-lakh-fraud-in-crypto,2024-10-25,25,10,2024,"Ahmedabad police officers are under the scrutiny for allegedly seizing ₹20 lakh from an individual in a case related to cryptocurrency. According to reports, the police seized ₹20 lakh from Sudarshan who was making a cryptocurrency deal with a man named Ashok. There are also suspicions over a ₹5 lakh deal between Ashok and the police, suggested reports. However, the deal may also be a farce to cover up an alleged collusion between Ashok and police. According to the details of the case, Ashok had built a relationship with Sudarshan, a businessman, over the past year, promising high returns on investments. He had lured Sudarshan into a cryptocurrency scheme, with the offer to buy ₹30 lakh worth of cryptocurrency for just ₹20 lakh. The agreement was that Sudarshan would only pay once the cryptocurrency was transferred to his wallet. Ashok and Sudarshan met near CG road, where Sudarshan had brought ₹20 lakh from an anagadia courier service and they were waiting for the crypto currency to transfer in Sudarshan's wallet. However, while they were waiting for the cryptocurrency transfer, police officers, including Mayur and Amit, reached the spot. Ashok and Sudarshan were then taken to the Navrangpura police station. A policeman, who had previously worked in Navrangpura and was now stationed in Vejalpur, asked Ashok to pay up ₹5 lakh to let go of the case as the transaction of the crypto currency is illegal. Ashok reportedly paid up the ₹5 lakh and had left the police station. Sudharshan was also asked to leave the police station and was informed that his ₹20 lakh will be returned to him after the legal proceedings. However, after three days passed without receiving the funds, he had tried to contact Ashok but his phone was switched off. And with the frustration of not receiving funds even after 3 days Sudarshan approached the Police commissioner and complained that he has not received the amount seized from him yet. Upon which the Police commissioner had ordered a probe into the matter and investigation is going on for the same. Currently, questions arise regarding the whereabouts of the ₹20 lakh and how the police got to know about the crypto dealing at the specific location. Speculations are also rife about Ashok’s involvement with police, to lure Sudarshan and eventually seize money from him.

For context, the seized cash of ₹7.01 crore equals the value of four to five luxury apartments in Ahmedabad’s premium localities like S G Highway and Satellite Road. Two suspects, Mehsana residents Sanjay Rawal and Dawood Sindhi, had been travelling from New Delhi to Ahmedabad when they were halted at the border on October 24. They were detained when they could not explain the huge amount of cash found in their vehicle. “The driver and his passenger were unable to provide satisfactory explanations when questioned on the large sum of money they were carrying,” an official of the RIICO office of the Abu Road police said. “We have launched an investigation into who was meant to receive the cash in Ahmedabad.” Moving such a huge amount of unexplained cash automatically triggers serious anti-money laundering investigations. Indian laws restrict large cash transactions. Cash movements of ₹2 lakh and above must be reported/explained if questioned by authorities. Even banks have to report the movement of ₹10 lakh and above to the Financial Intelligence Unit, and the Income Tax department has the right to automatically initiate verification in cash transfers of ₹20 lakh and above.

In 1989, the Aryoday Spinning and Weaving Mill in Ahmedabad was closed down, leaving 3,288 workers without their dues. Since the mill’s closure, workers have received only about ₹1.45 crores—less than 5% of the total owed to them, which is around ₹26.95 crores. Notably, 60% of these workers have died over the years without getting any compensation. The legal hurdles have delayed payments, and although the land was offered for sale five times since 1989, it wasn’t until 2016 that the Supreme Court allowed the sale of leasehold land, opening the door for this recent transaction. In June 2024, a bidding process was initiated, where a company named Arham Developers placed the highest bid initially. However, another company, Devbhoomi Agrifresh, later expressed interest to buy the land for ₹75 crores and eventually secured the land for ₹82 crores in a renewed bid. The court has accepted this bid, paving the way for the long-overdue payments to the former workers. With ₹15 crores already deposited as earnest money by Devbhoomi Agrifresh, the deal is likely to be sealed, raising possibilities for compensation for the workers.

The timing of this theft is particularly concerning as Diwali approaches when many businesspersons and residents leave for vacation.

Police Inspector V Dhandhukiya, incharge of Khadia police station, suspects insider involvement in the heist. “The perpetrator demonstrated intimate knowledge of the premises, including the location of CCTV camera connections,” said Dhandhukiya. “The security cameras were deliberately disconnected before the break-in, preventing any video evidence of the crime.” While no major breakthrough has been reported yet, “We are analysing every aspect of the case, also trying to figure out how many people were involved in it,” Dhandhukiya added.",ahmedabad

The Court has ordered an FIR to be filed for the accused passing a bogus ruling over the Daskroi-Shahwadi land worth more than ₹2,000 crore. Morris issued illegal arbitration orders affecting over 100 acres of land and properties worth crores of rupees. The Court observed, “Christian has argued for the continuation of the fraudulent criminal act and has continued his fraudulent activities as well. This suggests he has committed an organised crime. Therefore, the registrar is ordered to file an FIR against Morris Samuel and others associated with him.” The Court also ordered to send a copy of its ruling to the urban development department, revenue department, home department, Ahmedabad collector, and the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC). Morris Samuel Christian, who faces multiple criminal charges, established an illegal court and tribunal, and 'ruled' on land disputes — including those under the jurisdiction of Ahmedabad district. He charged his clients ₹30 lakh per 'arbitration', as per the police, and named various officials from the government and the Amdavad Municipal Corporation as the “opposing party”. Karanj police had filed a complaint and launched an investigation. The court noted, “Earlier, the Gujarat High Court had initiated contempt of court proceedings against Morris, in which the accused had also apologised to the High Court. The High Court had explicitly warned Morris not to engage in such activities.” The Court also observed that “a complaint has been filed against Morris at Naranpura police station for impersonating a lawyer and committing fraud despite not being a legally qualified lawyer. Another complaint has been filed against Morris at Maninagar police station for the crime of committing fraud by acquiring possession of a house. Similarly, a complaint has also been filed at Chandkheda police station.” The Court has also penalised Vincent Oliver Carpenter, the proposer, according to the order in this case, of ₹50,000. Notably, the scam came to light when Christian issued an unauthorised arbitration award transferring government land in Paldi (Revenue Survey No. 306, Final Plot 32 of TP Scheme 6) to one Thakor Babuji Chhanaji. To enforce this award, Babuji Thakor filed a civil application in the Sessions Court, showing the Collector as the opposing party. Government advocates Haresh Shah and Vijay Sheth discovered irregularities in the application, and Justice JL Chovatiya declared Christian a bogus arbitrator. The primary investigation revealed that Christian had appointed himself as an arbitrator without government consent in violation of legal procedure. Investigators said that Christian’s fraudulent rulings affected at least 11 properties, with 10 cases still pending. Several government officials, including the collector, had already recorded some of these fraudulent awards in official revenue records.

Additionally, three traffic police vehicles are now equipped with AI dashboard cameras to capture violations such as riding without helmets or driving on the wrong side. There are plans to install 60 more AI dashboard cameras across the city and live zoom cameras at 390 different locations.

In the heart of the Pol area, three iconic Farsan shops continue to capture hearts and taste buds, each carrying forward a legacy that has made these treats synonymous with local festive celebrations for over six decades. 1) Ganthiya and Chawanu: A Time-Honored Taste Located in the bustling Dada Saheb Pol, New Bhavnagari Farsan House has been a beloved spot for authentic Gujarati Farsan since 1963. Established by Harshil Sheth’s grandfather, this shop introduced Ahmedabad to two distinct specialities — Vanela Ganthiya and Chawanu (namkeen mixture). Over the past 61 years, they’ve adhered to the same traditional recipe passed down through three generations. ""Our recipes and methods are a family treasure. It’s our commitment to tradition and the trust of our customers,"" shares Harshil Sheth, the current owner. The Vanela Ganthiya, celebrated for its crisp texture and balanced spice, pairs perfectly with the shop’s signature papaya chutney. This chutney, with its tangy-sweet notes, offers a unique contrast that enhances the flavours of the Ganthiya, making it an essential Diwali treat for Amdavadis.

The case, which had remained unsolved for over a decade, involved the brutal murder of Manish Sahay, whose body was discovered tied and hidden under a kitchen platform at his rented home. He was found dead in his rented apartment, with his body concealed beneath a kitchen platform. The accused, Ramesh Danabhai Desai, reportedly had a homosexual relationship with Gupta. The murder occurred after a violent argument, where Desai attacked Sahay with a metal object. Desai allegedly murdered Sahay following a dispute on June 29, 2010. After the crime, he stripped Sahay’s body, taped it, wrapped it in cloth, and concealed it beneath sand and cement under the kitchen sink of their rented Ahmedabad home. Sahay’s decomposed body was discovered days later, leading to an extensive investigation that ultimately resulted in Desai’s arrest over a decade later. According to Crime Branch officials, Ramesh fled the scene in 2010 and evaded law enforcement by assuming a false identity. Recently, investigators identified his movements and tracked him from Mumbai to Rajasthan. The suspect initially presented fake identification but was ultimately identified due to regional speech patterns and distinct mannerisms. In his confession, Ramesh reportedly detailed a personal dispute that escalated, leading to the murder.

This time, his schedule has been disrupted for the past few years, and admissions are now happening much later. The PG Medical NEET was conducted on August 11, 2024, and subsequently, results were declared on August 23, while scorecards were released on August 30. This year, the exam was conducted in two sessions as per the new exam pattern by the National Board of Examinations (NBE) and students were opposing the new pattern. Students have complained that only percentiles were declared, not scores, and the answer key has also not been officially released. They have raised complaints about the transparency of the exam and have even filed a petition in the Supreme Court. The last hearing in the Supreme Court was on October 25, but the court adjourned the hearing with the next hearing on November 19. Thus, the final admission process can only begin after the Supreme Court's verdict on the controversy surrounding the NEET results process. Currently, online registrations have begun for the All India Quota (AIQ) seats for PG medical courses and state quota seats. However, counselling, choice filling and seat allotment is yet to start. The current PG third-year residents are preparing for their January exams. Furthermore, many senior residents are not extending their residencies.

Pankaj Patel, a resident of Bopal, Ahmedabad, was defrauded of ₹75 lakh by Chiman Patel of Jodhpur, Ahmedabad, and his sons, Bhavin and Manish Patel, who are currently in Australia. Pankaj was an acquaintance to Chiman and whenever Manish visited India, he would encourage Pankaj to settle in Australia, explaining that if he came on an investor visa, his family could accompany him. In August 2021, Manish sent Pankaj pictures of land and documents, asking for ₹75 lakh for the investment. Trusting Manish and his family, Pankaj transferred the money, with half money into Chiman’s account and the rest into Bhavin’s account, as instructed by Manish. Two months later, Manish had emailed Pankaj with documents claiming the deal was closed with Dhaval Shah. However, the documents lacked proper stamps and signatures. Manish also stated that, according to Australian law, he could not send the original documents by courier. This raised Pankaj’s suspicions, leading him to investigate the documents, where he discovered they were fake.

At around 7 am, Kushwaha, who had been living away from his family due to a prolonged dispute, visited the family home to observe Dhanteras. However, an argument quickly escalated, leading to violence. Kushwaha allegedly attacked his wife, Asha (40), and their six-year-old daughter, Dhara, with iron pipes and stones. Dhara tragically died on the spot, while Asha, gravely injured, was immediately taken to LG Hospital, where she remains in critical condition. Following the attack, Kushwaha himself contacted the police control room to report the incident. Ramol Police has taken Kushwaha into custody. Assistant Commissioner of Police Krunal Desai, Division I, confirmed that the couple had been entangled in a family dispute over the past two years, prompting Kushwaha to live at his workplace.

In the circular, CP stated that in some police stations in Ahmedabad, 24-hour shifts are being alloted, allowing police personnel to be free for the next 24 hours. This practice affects the physical and mental health of police personnel, according to CP. Due to continuous duty, it becomes difficult to provide timely and effective justice in law and order issues. Drivers and other staff working in the police station’s first mobile, second mobile, prisoner mobile, PCR, and other vehicles will have to work 8-hour shifts and 12-hour shifts in case of emergencies. The supervisors and officials must report if the staff work for a 24-hour shift. ‘Disciplinary action will be taken against such police personnel,’ according to the circular.

However, after the sale of any vehicle, the responsibility for paying the vehicle tax is typically taken on by the dealers. Reports indicate that during 2019 to 2021, the municipal corporation issued unpaid tax notices to over 64,000 vehicle owners. The tax department sought information from the Regional Transport Office (RTO) for vehicle owners registered in the areas under the jurisdiction of the AMC, particularly in Subhash Bridge and Vastral. When a person purchases a new vehicle, dealers usually handle the lifetime vehicle tax and provide the receipt along with the RTO book to the vehicle owner. Despite this practice, the tax department officials had no information regarding how many new vehicles were registered with the RTO in 2022 and 2023, or how much revenue the AMC received from vehicle taxes for those registrations. During a recent revenue committee meeting, officials from the tax department were asked for details on all categories of vehicles registered with the RTO, the number of vehicle owners, and the outstanding vehicle tax amounts. However, the officials were unable to provide clear answers. The committee concluded the meeting by instructing the officials to issue unpaid tax notices to all vehicle owners who owe taxes.

""Upon arrival, the team found the flames had already engulfed multiple vehicles and shops within the market,"" a fire official reported. Initially, five engines arrived on the scene, but as the fire escalated, additional resources were brought in. After battling the flames for hours, the firefighting team managed to bring the situation under control by early morning, using around 4 to 5 lakh litres of water. Cooling operations continued until 9 a.m. to prevent any potential reignition. The blaze affected a significant portion of the market, particularly shops selling secondhand goods like old clothes and vehicles. The intensity of the fire was such that sparks spread to a neighbouring building, briefly igniting a smaller blaze, which the fire brigade quickly extinguished. Due to the dense smoke and close proximity of combustible items, controlling the situation proved challenging and required extensive effort. Jayesh Khadia, Additional Chief Fire Officer, shared, ""The incident occurred late at night, prompting us to send 21 fire engines with a team of 100 firefighters to the spot. While no casualties were reported, five to six shops were completely gutted. Our team remained on site for cooling operations until around 9 am.""

Gujarat HC sets aside charge sheet issued near retirement,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-hc-sets-aside-charge-sheet-issued-near-retirement,2024-11-01,1,11,2024,"The Gujarat High Court has quashed and set aside a charge sheet issued against a government employee at the fag end of her service. A bench headed by Justice A.S. Supehia was hearing a letters patent appeal filed against the May 2024 order passed by a single-judge bench rejecting the writ petition filed by the appellant, who served as a Director of Accounts and Treasury (Class-I), challenging the charge sheet issued in May 2021. The appellant, who was due to retire on reaching the age of superannuation in September 2022, was issued the charge sheet in May 2021 containing three charges. In her appeal, the appellant stated that two charges were dropped by the state government and the third charge from 2013 stated that before renewing the passport, no “No Objection Certificate” (NOC) was obtained by the appellant from the state government. The appellant contended that the bare reading of Rule 3(1) of the Gujarat Civil Services (Conduct) Rules would establish that the third charge would not fall under the definition of misconduct. Further, she contended that the Office Memorandum issued by the Ministry of External Affairs did not provide that not obtaining an NOC for the renewal of the passport would amount to misconduct. The Bench, also comprising Justice Gita Gopi, in its judgment, said that ""the entire charge sheet is blissfully silent, so far the aspect of delay is concerned, and even the affidavit-in-reply does not mention any reason as to why for a renewal of a passport in the year 2013, for which it is alleged that the appellant has not obtained the NOC, the charge-sheet has been issued on 24.05.2021 at the fag end of retirement"". Referring to several Supreme Court judgements which had quashed and set aside the charge sheet on the ground of inordinate and unexplained delay, the Gujarat High Court quashed and set aside the third charge against the appellant. Further, it reasoned that the appellant had obtained NOC at the time of getting the passport, but she did not obtain the same at the time of renewal. ""It cannot be said that non-obtaining of NOC at the time of renewal of the passport will be tantamount to 'lack of integrity' or 'lack of devotion towards duty'. The act of the appellant can at the most be termed as 'lapse' on her part,"" said the Gujarat HC in its judgment. It added that the act of the appellant was neither gross nor habitual negligence nor can it be said that her conduct was so egregious, which resulted in grave consequences and irreparable damage was caused to the state government. On the overall analysis of the facts and the manner in which the charge sheet was issued at the fag end of service of the appellant, the high court said that it indicated that the same was done with a mala fide intention. After the overall substratum and analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case, the Gujarat High Court allowed the appeal with a cost of ₹10,000 and quashed and set aside the third charge. ""The cost of ₹10,000 shall be paid to the appellant within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of the writ of this Order. It will be open for the state government to recover the cost amount of ₹10,000 from the erring Officer, who has issued the charge sheet,” the HC ordered.

Eight teams of Surendranagar police were tasked with nabbing a trailer truck driver and locating a Hyundai Creta car involved in the tragic accident, which took the life of the Gandhinagar SMC’s Police Sub-Inspector (PSI). PSI Pathan’s team was in pursuit of a vehicle suspected to be involved in illegal liquor transport on Tuesday. Pathan succumbed to the injuries shortly after he was hospitalised. Senior officials rap Surendranagar police Surendranagar Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) constituted eight teams to probe this case, which scrutinised footage from around 80 CCTV cameras. But no substantial breakthrough was made in five days of probing. In a meeting chaired by the Range Inspector General (IG) to review the investigation, the police officials were unable to present satisfactory answers. As the matter rose through the ranks, DGP Vikas Sahay and SMC Superintendent of Police (SP) Nirlipt Rai expressed their concerns over the probe. Following this, the case was transferred to Ahmedabad Rural LCB, and the case is now under the supervision of Ahmedabad Rural SP Om Prakash Jat. SMC officer loses life in the line of duty The fatal accident occurred on the Dasada-Patdi road near Kathada village around 2.30 am, when the PSI and his team attempted to intercept the suspects. According to police sources, the SMC team had set up a checkpoint on the Kathada village turn after receiving intelligence about a suspicious vehicle — a Creta car believed to be carrying contraband liquor. However, the vehicle driver ignored the checkpoint and attempted to speed past, overtaking a large trailer truck to evade capture. PSI Pathan and his team, trailing the vehicle in a Fortuner, accelerated in an attempt to block the Creta from escaping. During the high-speed chase, the situation took a dangerous turn as the trailer and Creta manoeuvred perilously close to each other. In the chaos, the Fortuner carrying PSI Pathan collided with the side of the trailer, causing the police vehicle to veer off the road. PSI Pathan sustained severe head injuries in the collision. Despite being rushed to the Dasada Primary Health Centre and then transferred to Viramgam Government Hospital, he succumbed to his injuries shortly after his arrival.

"Ahmedabad Shopping Festival flops: High rents, low turnout drive vendors away",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-shopping-festival-flops-high-rents-low-turnout-drive-vendors-away,2024-11-11,11,11,2024,"High rents and poor sales have officially turned the city’s “Shopping Festival” into a flop, with Law Garden and Sindhu Bhavan Road (SBR), among 18 locations, turning into mere selfie destinations. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) planned the event as a 95-day extravaganza. However, four out of seven food stalls at Law Garden have shut down within 29 days of the festival’s launch, while 10 out of 12 food vendors at SBR have also closed their operations. Vendors cite the unsustainable daily rent of ₹3,000 (₹3,500 with GST) as the primary reason for closure. “Our daily income ranges between ₹150 and ₹350,” said an employee at the only operational stall at Law Garden. Opening day revenues were particularly dismal, with one stall reporting earnings of just ₹76, while some vendors failed to make any sales. At SBR, only artisan stalls remain operational due to their rent-free arrangements. “We don't have to pay rent,” explained one artisan vendor. “But food vendors here are paid stallholders, and most have left because the cost is too high.” One persisting food vendor at SBR stated, “We’ve already paid the rent in advance, so we’re staying for now. Otherwise, we would have closed much earlier.” Of the handful that remain, many stallowners have left their setups unattended, stating they cannot cover both rent and staff salaries. The lack of attractive promotional offers has further contributed to low customer turnout. On the other hand, the AMC’s additions of lighting and selfie points have drawn the attention of entertainment-starved, selfie-seeking youth — but that is hardly the silver lining vendors were looking for.

Petitioner claims false arrest by Ahmedabad police in alleged visa scam,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/petitioner-claims-false-arrest-by-ahmedabad-police-in-alleged-visa,2024-11-12,12,11,2024,"In a case related to a visa scam in Gujarat High Court, a petitioner accused Ahmedabad’s Anand Nagar police of falsely getting remand instead of arresting the main accused. The petitioner Radhika Dhameliya said that the main accused named in the police complaint were given ‘special treatment’ and not questioned properly. Instead, they demanded custody of Dhameliya after arresting her from Surat. It all started when a senior supervisor Ketan Nayak working at Gujarat Ambuja Exports Limited paid ₹23.50 lakh to Anand Nagar-based consultancy operators Daksh Goswami and Arohi Patel. Despite paying the sum, he did not receive any updates from the consultancy and the operators began to ignore his calls. He filed a complaint at Anand Nagar Police Station followed by which, Goswami and Patel were detained. However, they named Surat-based Radhika Dhameliya, an operator at Kanak Immigration Consultancy. In the petition, Dhameliya clarified that she was wrongly arrested. She had paid ₹14 lakh to Goswami via the RTGS payment system after the visa was not processed. According to the petitioner, instead of detaining the main accused named in the complaint, the police gained her custody from a local court.

The families allege that the doctors admitted the patients without following a proper procedure and conducted the medical procedure to earn from MA card (Mukhyamantri Amrutam card). The patients were given stents without consulting their families, which led to the death of the patients. Health Minister Rushikesh Patel has ordered an investigation into the incident.

In the figures released by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC), the air quality index (AQI) of the city’s famous SG Highway stretch is found to be in ‘very poor’ condition. Other areas of the city, including Naroda and Odhav, are found to have an average AQI of 100 throughout the year. This figure substantially surpasses the national average of 40. Moreover, the AQI of Maninagar is also found to be between the ‘moderate’ and ‘poor’ categories. The air quality of areas such as Ashram Road, Prahladnagar, Vastrapur, and Sardar Patel Stadium has also deteriorated towards the ‘poor’ from the ‘moderate’ category. Their AQI is lingering over the 200-mark. Nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and sulfur oxide are found to be in significant proportion in the air of the Vatva area. Among vicinities in the walled city area, Khadia and Dariyapur have the worst AQI, as they have drastically deteriorated towards the ‘very poor’ from the ‘poor’ category. The air quality is determined by checking the proportion of PM2.5 (particulate matter), nitrogen oxide, PM10, and carbon, among other pollutants, in the air. Notably, the AMC, GPCB, and IIT Gandhinagar monitor the pollution levels in the city. The cold, heavy winds of winter cause polluted particles to lay lower in the atmosphere, increasing the risk of health problems.

The Court came down heavily on the probing officials over their inability to produce worthwhile evidence against the accused. Hearing the case, the Court acquitted Haji Mohammad Altaf Sarad, alias Mohammed Aslam, along with Mohammad Amir Shakilahmed Shaikh and Saiyad Aaqib Saiyad Jakaruddin. The Court critically observed the shortcomings in the police investigation and remarked, “Considering the testimony of the investigating officer in this case, no details have been provided to clarify how the accused are involved in this crime. Only formal details have been provided, based on which it is difficult to link the accused to the charges of the case. The investigating officer could not clarify in his testimony or present any evidence regarding what kind of evidence was obtained against the accused.” The court further observed, “The police have not gone to the Pakistan Embassy in Delhi to probe the possible links of this case with Lashkar-e-Taiba or the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan.” It also mentioned, “No official of the organisations mentioned in the charge sheet has been investigated or their statements taken. No correspondence has been done anywhere regarding the existence of such organisations. Thus, even the testimony of the investigating officer itself is not helpful to the prosecution in linking the crime and the criminal.” The Court, therefore, observed that the accused were not involved in the collusion of this bomb blast under the circumstances presented before it. In its ruling, it also found that the statements of any witness in this case don’t prove the accused’s involvement. The bomb blast, which occurred in the wee hours of February 18, 2006, jolted the entire city to its core.

MICA student murder: Sarkhej police constable arrested from Punjab,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/mica-student-case-accused-police-constable-arrested-from-punjab,2024-11-13,13,11,2024,"MICA student murder case In a grim reflection of law enforcement failing its mandate, a road rage incident in Ahmedabad's Bopal area on Sunday night has left the city shaken. Priyanshu Jain, a 23-year-old MICA student, was fatally stabbed on November 10 after a heated argument over rash driving. Shockingly, the accused is Virendrasinh Padhiyar, a constable with the Sarkhej police station. Padhiyar was previously deployed at the city’s Narol Police Station, from where he was transferred to Sarkhej. After committing the crime, he reportedly absconded to Punjab. From there, he was nabbed by officials from the Ahmedabad Crime Branch. Sources in the know also suggest that he was under the influence of alcohol when the altercation occurred. The incident unfolded near the fire station in Bopal when Priyanshu and his friend, both riding a Bullet motorcycle, confronted the driver of a black luxury car for allegedly driving on the wrong side. The altercation turned violent when Virendrasinh stabbed Priyanshu and fled the scene. Priyanshu, rushed to a hospital by a passerby, succumbed to his injuries during treatment. The Ahmedabad Crime Branch tracked Virendrasinh to Punjab using details about his car. After stopping the vehicle, they confirmed it belonged to the Sarkhej constable. He was arrested and will be brought to Ahmedabad for further questioning to unravel the motive behind the murder. Investigators faced multiple challenges, including unclear CCTV footage and difficulty identifying the suspect’s car. Despite these hurdles, the Ahmedabad Rural Police, along with other agencies, worked relentlessly to crack the case. According to officials, the incident occurred after 10:30 PM near a bakery in South Bopal. Priyanshu and his friend, Prithviraj Mohapatra, were returning from a tailoring shop when the confrontation occurred. The stabbing happened approximately 200 meters from the initial argument site. Prithviraj, a fellow MICA student, filed a complaint against the unidentified attacker, which eventually led to Virendrasinh’s arrest. Forensic teams have collected evidence from the crime scene for further analysis. Both Priyanshu and Prithviraj were second-year students who had attended a campus interview earlier that day. Their evening outing turned fatal in an act of senseless violence that raises unsettling questions about safety, even for those entrusted to maintain it.",ahmedabad
Four industrial sheds erected in Dariyapur with bogus ASI NOC,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/four-industrial-sheds-erected-in-dariyapur-with-bogus-asi-noc,2024-11-13,13,11,2024,"A total of four industrial sheds based on a bogus non-objection certificate (NOC) from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was constructed in Dariyapur of Ahmedabad. In a similar case to this, in 2018, the NOC presented by the builder of ‘Salman Avenue’ to the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was revealed to be bogus. The ASI submitted that no such NOC was issued in 2015, as claimed by the builder. Now the estate department of AMC has taken action after it was informed by ASI about the sheds in Dariyapur with ASI’s bogus NOC located at part-127 of final plot no-146 of TP Scheme No 14. After the ASI informed the AMC, the estate department cancelled the leave letter and issued a notice to demolish the construction in 2017. A petition was also filed in the court in 2019 against this. Salman Avenue’s bogus NOC With Salman Avenue, the Gujarat High Court had provided two months to the builder to obtain the NOC, ordering a 'status quo' after AMC had issued a notice of demolition. However, no NOC was obtained during those two months. Despite that, no action has been taken by the Estates and Legal Department of the AMC for the last six years. Officials of the legal department were unable to explain the inaction against the construction for six years despite the lack of NOC. The builder was required to acquire an NOC from the ASI since the construction site falls within 100 meters of a historical monument.",ahmedabad
How PM-JAY became source of income for hospitals in Gujarat,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/how-pmjay-became-source-of-income-for-hospitals-in-gujarat,2024-11-13,13,11,2024,"The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) seems to be increasingly turning into a tool to earn money for private hospitals, instead of helping the citizens as intended. PM-JAY was started under Ayushman Bharat for over 12 crores of poor and vulnerable families to provide free medical examinations and treatment. The private hospitals have turned the beneficiary scheme of the poor into a source of income. In 2023, the CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) audit report revealed irregularities in hospitals of Gujarat under this scheme. The CAG report highlighted details such as hospitals treating more patients than the number of beds available. Hospitals claimed millions of rupees from the government under the guise of providing treatment. As per the CAG report 2023, during the period from January 2021 to March 2021, auditors visited 50 hospitals in Gujarat and found irregularities, such as hospitals treating more patients than bed-capacity. These 50 hospitals had a total of 2,552 beds, but 5,217 patients were treated during various dates. For example, on March 8, 2021, in the Surendranagar Medico Multispecialty Hospital, there were 97 patients receiving treatment against the capacity of just 34 beds. As per reports, most of the treatments were recorded on paper only. There were also cases in Gujarat where patients were simultaneously admitted to multiple hospitals. It was revealed that 21,514 patients were receiving treatment in different hospitals at the same time. This indicates that the treatment was merely a paper exercise. According to the CAG report, by November in 2022, the state had paid a total of ₹3,507.72 crore under the PM-JAY scheme, covering 14,12,311 cases. Despite these irregularities, the state health department continued to pay millions to the hospitals. Khyati Hospital row Ahmedabad’s Khyati Hospital has been in hot water after two patients from Kadi died after doctors at the hospital allegedly conducted an angioplasty on them to benefit from PM-JAY. Khyati Hospital has claimed ₹27,70,96,003 from the government for over 600 cardiology treatments. Moreover, the hospital made claims worth ₹3.66 crore in just 6 months. A total of 380 angiographies, 220 angioplasties and 36 coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries were done by the hospital. Between June 1 to 12, the hospital claimed funds for 650 cases from the Health Department.

A team from U N Mehta Institute of Cardiology & Research Centre and GMERS Civil Hospital, Sola, will investigate the matter and determine whether patients needed angiography or angioplasty. The team will also watch surgical CDs of seven patients who underwent angioplasty. The report prepared by the team will be submitted to the Health Commissioner for further action. The entire incident came to light after Khyati Hospital organised a ‘free camp’ under Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY). However, no such camps are allowed under PMJAY. In the preliminary investigation, it was revealed that the hospital organised the camp without permission. After the incident became public, there was a brouhaha among the citizens. The Gujarat Medical Council also took the matter into consideration. A notice was issued on Tuesday to Khyati Hospital's CEO Chirag Rajput, Dr Prashant Vazirani, Dr Sanjay Patoliya, and Rajshri Kothari. According to reports, the management of the hospital has gone underground. Mammoth claims Khyati Hospital has claimed ₹27,70,96,003 from the government for over 600 cardiology treatments.

Of these patients, stents were placed in 7 of them. Their relatives were not informed before the stents were placed. They were informed only after the deaths of two patients. To take advantage of the PMJAY, the hospital performed unnecessary surgeries on patients,” he alleged. However, hospital CEO Chirag Rajput said, “With the cooperation of the sarpanch, a camp was held in Borisana village. Twenty patients were told to come to Ahmedabad for further investigation. The patients came to our hospital for treatment of their own will. The police investigation is currently underway and the truth will come out. All these operations were performed by gold medallist Dr Vazirani.” Khyati Hospital case timeline November 10: -Khyati Hospital organised a free heart camp in Borisana village, Kadi. -120 patients were examined, 19 of whom were diagnosed with heart problems. -The camp team consisted of 4 nurses, Dr Ajaysinh Vaghela, Dr Minal Maheshwari, and 10 other members. -The camp included ECG, sugar reports, and pulse rate checks. -Patients were asked to sign a form, which is claimed to be an angiography consent form.

MICA student stabbed in road rage incident; police constable arrested,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/mica-student-stabbed-in-road-rage-incident-police-constable-arrested,2024-11-14,14,11,2024,"Accused Virendrasinh Padhiyar The brutal murder of 23-year-old MICA student Priyanshu Jain in a road rage incident has left the city in shock, especially as the accused, Virendrasinh Padhiyar, is a police constable with a troubling criminal history. The black Harrier used in the crime belonged to Padhiyar’s friend. Police traced his movements using tollbooth CCTV footage, which revealed his escape route. After stabbing Priyanshu, Padhiyar fled to his home in South Bopal, where he told his family he was leaving for Vaishno Devi. Subsequently, he contacted a friend who runs a travel agency to book an Innova and sought assistance from another friend, Dilip Salave, before fleeing to Punjab. Sharad Singhal, JCP, Crime Branch, stated, “At the time of the crime, Virendrasinh was alone in the car. However, during his escape to Punjab, a friend was driving the vehicle. It remains to be seen if this individual was complicit in the crime.” Padhiyar’s past as a constable raises serious concerns. Suspended in 2017 for running an illegal call center while posted at Satellite Police Station, he faced suspension again in 2022 for insubordination toward a senior officer. Reinstated in 2023, he had been on sick leave since October 28 for reasons now under investigation. Further inquiries revealed Padhiyar’s carefully planned escape. After fleeing his home, he used a private vehicle to travel through Hanumangarh, Mandi, Jalandhar, and Chandigarh before reaching Sanaur village in Punjab, where he stayed at a guest house under a fake name. DCP Ajit Rajan confirmed, “The accused was arrested in Sanaur village, Punjab, where he was staying under a fake identity. We have not yet recovered the knife used in the crime, as he disposed of it during his escape.” Ahmedabad Rural Police reconstructed the crime scene on Thursday, during which Padhiyar reportedly broke down under questioning. Superintendent of Police Om Prakash Jat revealed, “During the investigation, we tracked down around 70 black cars that were in the area at the time of the crime. This led us to Padhiyar’s house when it was discovered his vehicle was missing.” The investigation faced significant challenges as the tollbooth CCTV footage was unclear, making it difficult to identify the vehicle. Officers relied on the colour of the car to comb through footage and narrow down the suspects. Regarding Padhiyar’s unchecked history within the police force and the systemic failures that allowed him to remain in service despite repeated suspensions. Jaya Deshmukh, Director & CEO of MICA Ahmedabad said, “On behalf of MICA, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the police department for their swift response. We are grateful for their assistance in identifying the perpetrator.” Also read: MICA student murder: Sarkhej police constable arrested from Punjab MICA student stabbed to death in Ahmedabad after altercation over reckless driving",ahmedabad
"Gujarat’s Zardosi work has a growing demand in Italy, France",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarats-zardosi-work-has-a-growing-demand-in-italy-france,2024-11-14,14,11,2024,"Gujarat’s ‘Khatla’ work is popular in France and Italy. Moreover, the labour comes at a fraction of the cost. More than 40,000 artisans in Gujarat, particularly from Dholka and surrounding areas such as Khanpur, Kalupur, Narol, and Vatva in Ahmedabad are engaged in Khatla work. The demand for ‘Khatla’ work, also known by names like ‘Zardosi Marodi’, has grown significantly, not only in India, but internationally as well. Ahmedabad textile expert Vijaybhai explains that to produce this work in France and Italy, the cloth is first cut and embroidered by skilled artisans here, then sewn together in European countries. This enables European countries to label the final product as Made in France or Made in Europe. Due to the lower labour costs in Gujarat, most of the embroidery work is outsourced to Ahmedabad. Dholka alone is home to over 20,000 Zardosi workers who have built a unique identity through their craft. During festivals like Diwali and the wedding season, these artisans provide exquisite Zardosi-embroidered clothing to people in Ahmedabad. While various regions in Kutch are known for their craftsmanship, the artisans from Narol, Dholka, and Ahmedabad have gained a reputation for Zardosi work not only in Gujarat but across India over the past two decades. Major merchants in Ahmedabad, who source fabric from all over India, specifically turn to the artisans of Dholka for Zardosi work on sarees, sherwanis, dupattas, and wedding gowns. Zaved Khan, a 65-year-old Zardosi Marodi artisan who has been working in Pakhali Chowk, Dholka, for the past 50 years, says that the younger generation learns this craft by watching their elders. He notes that if learned properly, it can take many years to master. Currently, there are over 20,000 Zardosi artisans in Dholka, with most of them getting work from traders in Ahmedabad, Surat, and Mumbai. An artisan can earn around Rs. 1,000 a day, working peacefully. If a whole family, including women, participates in the work, they can earn enough to cover their expenses and save. In the age of the internet, artisans can now directly connect with traders. The materials used for Zardosi work include silk, beads, threads, and various other fine items like Kadabas, Dhari, Surmo, and Zardosi. This is a delicate craft where precision and patience are essential. A skilled artisan can earn more by producing higher-quality work. Although this craft originally belonged to the royal courts of Uttar Pradesh, it gradually moved to Gujarat. With the wedding season now starting, demand for Zardosi work is high in cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, and Rajkot. As a result, both artisans and traders are seeing good profits from providing Khatla work services.

The hospital has been accused of subjecting patients – showing up at their camp for knee and back issues – to heart-related procedures such as cardiogram. At a ‘free camp’ organised by the hospital  at Borisana in Kadi on November 10, the doctors at the camp convinced several patients of having serious heart problems. As a result, ECGs (electrocardiography) were performed even on patients with complaints of knee and back pain. Medical check-ups were conducted for 45 people at the said camp, with most of them referred to undergo ECG. Do you have Ayushman Card? Doctors in private hospitals usually prey on Ayushman Card holders to achieve the highest possible amount of the receipt. At the free camp by the hospital, they sought Ayushman Cards from patients. A patient recalls, “I went for an eye check-up as I had been experiencing a burning sensation in my eyes daily. The doctor asked if I had an Ayushman Card, and when I said yes, he instructed me to get an ECG done in a specific room. I was shocked that why would I need an ECG for eye issues? They even suggested I come to Ahmedabad for free treatment.” Another patient suffering from leg and knee pain shared, “I attended the medical camp, and after the examination, the doctor advised me that my heart wasn’t receiving enough blood, which was causing me issues. All doctors asked if I had an Ayushman Card and assured me that everything would be free, with top doctors in Ahmedabad ready to treat me, even covering food and lodging.” It was alleged that the doctors tampered with the reports of patients, indicating a 90% blockage in the heart, though none of the patients had actual blockages in their heart vessels. After the hospital performed angioplasty on seven patients, two patients who underwent surgery by Dr Prashant Vazirani died. Vazirani was arrested by the police after a surgeon at GMERS, Sola, filed a complaint against Dr Vazirani, Dr Sanjay Patolia, Rajshri Kothari, and hospital CEO Chirag Rajput. As per reports, Vazirani, who performed angioplasty, is not even listed on Khyati Hospital’s panel of doctors.

It all started 8-10 years ago, when Dr Sanjay Patolia, a Rajkot-based bariatric surgeon established the Asian Bariatric hospital in a prime location at the Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway in Ahmedabad. However, after the hospital’s initial partners backed off, the hospital was renamed Khyati Multispeciality Hospital, based on its association with Khyati Group. The group’s website reads, “specialisation in real estate, education, health care, pulp & paper industry & infrastructure”. Dr Patolia, who continued his association with the hospital, currently faces action in the Kadi patients’ death case. The medical officer who is part of the investigating team contacted New Life Hospital of Rajkot owned by Dr Patolia and got to know that he visits Rajkot OPD for surgeries every Thursday. However, his six surgeries lined-up for Tuesday were cancelled after the Khyati hospital scam came out. Illegal business?

The case has sent shockwaves through the city, and police officials are piecing together the sequence of events leading to the brutal crime committed on Sunday night. During interrogation, the police uncovered that the black Tata Harrier used by Padhiyar during the incident belonged to his brother-in-law, Vishal Parmar. A senior police official stated, “The car is owned by Parmar, but it was being used by Padhiyar.” Additionally, Padhiyar’s friend, Dilip Salvi, a resident of Narol, has also been detained in connection with the case. Salvi was reportedly driving the car as Padhiyar fled to Punjab. During questioning, Salvi claimed he was unaware of the crime. “I didn’t know about the crime Padhiyar had committed. I only accompanied him for the darshan of Vaishno Devi,” he told investigators. Meanwhile, the police are intensifying their efforts to recover the murder weapon and the clothes worn by the accused at the time of the crime. “We are still searching for the weapon used to stab the victim and the clothes Padhiyar was wearing during the crime,” said a senior police official.

With the original prices of Silver and Gold passes set at ₹3,000 and ₹5,000 respectively, secondary ticket sellers are charging five times the actual price. Silver passes have soared to ₹15,000, while Gold passes are being resold for as much as ₹20,000 through platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook groups. The surge in prices hasn’t demotivated his fans, many of whom are travelling from various cities to attend the concert. “I will be travelling from Ankleshwar to Ahmedabad for the Diljit concert with my friends on Sunday,” said Sanket Prajapati, 24, a working professional. “I’m travelling with my friend, who is a huge Diljit fan. I’m just accompanying her.” There is no age barrier when it comes to attending Diljit’s concerts – fans of all ages are eager to be part of the experience. Hetal Kothari, 54, a media professional in Ahmedabad, explained his experience, I am a huge Diljit fan, and I’m attending the concert with four other friends. My friends bought Silver pass tickets for ₹8,000 each. The original price for these tickets is ₹3,000. I am pretty disappointed with the management, but as I am a huge Diljit fan, I had to buy the tickets.” Kamya Shah, a 22-year-old student currently residing in Ahmedabad for her studies, is especially excited to attend the show. She says, “I was just waiting for Diljit’s concert to happen in Ahmedabad. This is my first time seeing him live! I follow him on social media and have listened to every song of his. I’m super excited for the concert!” Dev (name changed), 28, from Thane, stated,  “I travelled from Thane to Ahmedabad and am staying at a hotel, for which I had to pay a surge price of ₹18,000 for one night. I paid ₹10,000 for the Gold pass ticket, which I bought from one of my friends. I had to get a ticket for the Ahmedabad concert because I’m a huge Diljit fan. I’m here alone for the concert, but I’m excited to maybe make some new friends.” Meet Parwani, 24, a businessman from Vadodara, who is travelling to Ahmedabad for the Diljit concert on Sunday. He shares, “As a hardcore Diljit fan, I had tried to get tickets for the Mumbai concert too, but I wasn’t lucky. Fortunately, I managed to get tickets for the Ahmedabad concert from a friend at the original ticket price.” Nik (name changed), 22, a working professional from Ahmedabad shared, “I had bought the ticket in the pre-sale of the pixel event.” Nik also mentioned that he had bought extra tickets during the initial sale with the intention of reselling them at a higher price later. “I’m part of WhatsApp groups where people are currently selling Diljit concert tickets in the black market,” he said, revealing the growing underground ticket-selling network surrounding the concert. This is not only driving people to pay inflated prices but is also fuelling the black-market ticket trade. For many, the chance to see Diljit live is worth every penny – even if it means paying above the original ticket price or buying from unauthorised sources.

Narmada, who lived alone, was found dead with severe injuries, including her ears being severed to steal her earrings. The stolen valuables included a gold necklace, two gold bangles, two gold rings, and a pair of earrings, together worth ₹1.2 lakh. Ahmedabad Rural Police swung into action immediately upon receiving the report at 4.30 pm. Teams from the Special Operations Group (SOG) and Local Crime Branch (LCB) were deployed, supported by a dog squad, forensic experts, and fingerprint analysts. “The dog squad proved crucial in the investigation,” said a senior police official. “They led us to the weapon and the cloth used in the crime, and ultimately to the accused.” The accused was identified as Ramesh Thakor, neighbour of the victim, who used to work as a labour in the village. Thakor was arrested within hours. During interrogation, he confessed to the crime and detailed the sequence of events. According to the police, he targeted Narmada’s house around 1.15 pm on Tuesday. Initially, he attempted to enter through the terrace but found the door locked. He then approached the main entrance and knocked.  “Narmada knew the accused and allowed him inside. While they were talking, she went to get water. It was then that Thakor attacked her from behind, strangling her to death,” revealed a police official. After killing her, Thakor severed her ears to remove her earrings and fled with the stolen jewellery. “The accused has been arrested by the police and further investigation of the matter is going” said a senior police official.

Khyati hospital consultant Dr Prashant Vazirani remanded in 7-day custody,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/khyati-hospital-row-consultant-dr-prashant-vazirani-on-seven-day-remand,2024-11-15,15,11,2024,"Two days after the alleged PM-JAY scam at Ahmedabad’s Khyati hospital was busted, one of the accused, Dr Prashant Vazirani was remanded in 7-day custody by the Ahmedabad Rural Court. Vazirani had reportedly conducted angiographies and angioplasties on innocent patients, which they apparently did not require, leading to the death of two individuals. Amid tight security, the accused cardiologist was presented before the court on Thursday. The remand application hearing lasted 35 minutes, after which Judge Chopra remanded the accused Vazirani in custody until November 21. To avoid the media, the police presented the accused directly in court through the back door. However, a sense of outrage was evident among the lawyers and parties involved. Reasons provided for the remand To determine how many unnecessary angiograms and angioplasties were performed by the accused To understand how the accused managed to process surgeries under PM-JAY on 19 patients A committee appointed by the government will question the accused regarding the recovered files of 19 patients To find out the involvement of Dr Rajendra Khambhete and Rahul Jain in the crime as the directors of Khyati Hospital To obtain the names and addresses of Khyati Group owners Dr Sanjay Patoliya, Raj Shri Kothari, Chirag Rajput, and others for custodial interrogation Who is the doctor who ordered angiograms for the 19 patients after they were brought to the hospital? An investigation to determine if bogus papers were created to perform unnecessary angiograms and angioplasties To identify other individuals involved in this scam and their role in assisting the accused The police need to investigate the operations of Khyati Hospital under PM-JAY since 2021 and check the hospital’s bank accounts To ascertain whether angiography of seven patients can be done in a day Moreover, a government-appointed committee will question the accused regarding the recovered files of 19 patients Investigation has revealed that the two patients lost their lives after the angioplasty. At that time Dr Vazirani was absent. Another doctor administered treatment to both patients at that time. His name is yet to be disclosed by Vazirani. While the police are investigating the case, two out of seven patients from Borisana who underwent angioplasty are under treatment. One patient is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Kadi after breathing problems and suffocation followed by surgery. Another one is getting treatment at the U N Mehta Institute of Cardiology in Ahmedabad. Lookout notice for owner Separate teams of police are searching for the CEO Chirag Rajput (resident of Rivera Blues, Makarba), Rajshri Kothari (resident of Aditya Bungalows, Thaltej), and Sanjay Patolia (resident of Thaltej). Moreover, a case which was registered regarding the deaths of two patients from Kadi was transferred to Vastrapur police station. GMC’s second notice to Khyati hospital The Gujarat Medical Council (GMC) issued a notice to the hospital on Tuesday and another one on Thursday, demanding an explanation regarding alleged negligence in the treatment of a patient who passed away. GMC also requested documents related to the hospital’s registration, ownership, C-Form, and registration certificates of all doctors practising there. There are discussions that even though the police have filed a complaint and evidence is present, the GMC is only issuing a notice instead of taking stricter action. As per the gravity of the situation, the GMC was supposed to immediately conduct a hearing and revoke the doctor’s and hospital’s licences. Profit-minded hospital Khyati hospital roughly earned ₹50,000 from PM-JAY by operating on one patient. The hospital reportedly paid ₹12,000-₹15,000 to consultant Dr Vazirani, consequently, ₹ 10,000 to hospital staff, and ₹15,000 to ₹30,000 on each stent. This way, the hospital spent ₹50,000-₹60,000 on one patient and claimed ₹1,00,000-₹1,50,000 from the PM-JAY.

These tickets are being resold through social media platforms in black market sales, and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is closely monitoring these activities. So far, 10 individuals have been arrested for the illegal resale of tickets. The original prices of the Silver and Gold passes are ₹3,000 and ₹5,000, respectively. However, the price of Silver passes has skyrocketed to ₹15,000, while Gold passes are being sold for ₹20,000 through platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook groups. Meanwhile, fans of Diljit Dosanjh are going crazy over the tickets, and many are unknowingly purchasing fake ones. Sources from the ED report that many of these tickets are counterfeit, and the sellers are misleading people with fake tickets. In connection with the black market ticket sales for Diljit Dosanjh’s live concert, ED officials conducted raids at 13 locations across the country, seizing mobile phones, laptops, and SIM cards. Investigations are ongoing in Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur, Bangalore, and Chandigarh. Local police and officials from the GST department have also joined the probe, though they have remained tight-lipped about the specifics. These tickets are being sold with both Central and State GST included in the price. Officials have noted a high volume of black market ticket sales in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar but have not provided further details. Additionally, Coldplay, who recently announced some shows in India as part of their world tour, has also seen black-market ticket sales. Notably, a new concert in Ahmedabad has been announced by Coldplay for January 25. Ticket sales for this event will commence on Saturday, with BookMyShow as the official sales partner. However, many black marketers have already listed or scheduled the tickets on their websites. Platforms like Viagogo have already listed tickets for the Ahmedabad Coldplay concert, which will officially go on sale this Saturday.

In the world of Coldplay and pop concert hype, Gen Z can relish classical, semi-classical and fusion music at the well-lit Adalaj Ni Vav. Speaking to Gujarat Samachar Digital , Birwa Qureshi, founder, and artistic director of Crraft of Art, says, “We will continue to build our connection with the younger generation. However we all feel that there is a little disconnect between the heritage and the Gen Zs.” She went on to say that to ‘bridge this gap’ we need to make it ‘relevant’ to the younger generation. “The idea is to make it relevant and cater to the larger audience, so that they can get inspiration from their past rather than living in the past,” she added addressing Gujarat Samachar Digital at the presser.

What’s new? The festival, having a broader theme of ‘Drums of India’, will come alive with the harmony of traditional rhythms and the ambience of architectural marvel – Adalaj Ni Vav once again highlighting Crraft of Art’s commitment to ‘Celebrating Monuments with Music’. With the same zeal for the past 15 years, Birwa, Bharatanatyam and folk dancer and founder of the festival is reintroducing India’s historic landmarks to a modern audience, particularly engaging younger generations. Like tabla maestro Fazal Qureshi said in an earlier interview with Gujarat Samachar Digital, “We want people to see these heritage monuments with a new perspective. People often visit these heritage sites, but rarely do they behold and realise how minutely detailing the architecture is. This is our little bit for these heritage sites.” The event is back with a new element of ‘dance’ and ‘Dhol Tasha’. The evening will also feature performances by the Veergarjana Dhol Tashe Pathak and the Purulia Chhau Dance Academy. Sandhya Mridul, celebrated for her presence across television, film, and theatre, will host the event, adding her unique charm to the festival. “I have been around art my whole life, be it as a design student at Ahmedabad’s CEPT, as a folk dancer, marrying a tabla maestro,” says Birwa. She says, “It is the passion for beholding art in a contemporary way which has driven me to organise the Water Festival for 15 years without a break.""

Khyati hospital doctor admits  performing angioplasties on patients with less than 40% blockage,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/khyati-hospital-doctor-admits-performing-malpractice-on-patients,2024-11-16,16,11,2024,"The consulting doctor who has been remanded in seven days custody, revealed many facts during the interrogation regarding Ahmedabad-based Khyati Multispeciality Hospital’s wrongdoings. The Vastrapur police questioned Dr Prashant Vazirani as it began an investigation into allegations relating to surgeries and other issues concerning Khyati hospital, located on S G Highway, in Ahmedabad. During the investigation, police seized several documents from the hospital. Meanwhile, separate teams, including the Ahmedabad Crime Branch, have been mobilised to track down the absconding accused. Ahmedabad Crime Branch Police Inspector L L Chavda and his team took along Dr Vazirani as they inspected the hospital. They allegedly filed false reports under PM-JAY to perform unnecessary surgeries even in cases where the blockage was less than 40%. Further inquiries revealed that the hospital had set a target of more than 30 surgeries daily under PM-JAY. Vazirani admitted that the hospital charged ₹1.5 lakh for each angioplasty under PM-JAY, of which he was paid ₹15,000 per surgery and ₹800 for each angiography. Police are now gathering detailed records to determine how many surgeries were performed under PM-JAY at the hospital. Efforts to apprehend other accused, including Sanjay Patoliya, Rajshri Kothari, and Chirag Rajput have led to investigations at their residences and other locations. Patient discharged from civil hospital One patient, who was admitted to U N Mehta Hospital due to complications after undergoing angioplasty at Khyati hospital, was discharged after showing improvement. The patient had been admitted following deteriorating health on Tuesday, a day after the procedure. Khyati hospital conducted angiographies on 19 patients from Borisana village on November 10. To verify whether the procedures were properly conducted and if stents were genuinely necessary, the angiography CDs will be sent to the U N Mehta Hospital for analysis. Civil hospital doctors are expected to release their findings in the coming days. Accused consulting doctor’s malpractice Accused Dr Vazirani was said to be associated with eight other hospitals in Ahmedabad, including Sanjivani Hospital (Vastrapur), Jivraj Mehta Hospital (Vejalpur), Aarana Hospital (Paldi), AIIMS Hospital (Paldi), Health-1 Hospital (Sheelaj), and Artham Hospital (Polytechnic area).

In the early hours of Friday, the body of a 65-year-old land dealer, identified as Deepak Dashrathbhai Patel, was discovered near Garodiya village in Ahmedabad’s Bopal area. The accused, Indrajit Singh alias Munnabhai Vaghela, was apprehended within hours of the crime being reported, from a coordinated investigation by the Local Crime Branch (LCB), Special Operations Group (SOG), and the Bopal Police. The shocking murder came to light after Patel’s children, residing in the United States, tracked his location through his mobile phone. According to police sources, Patel, a land broker, suspected to be Vaghela, left his home around midnight. He informed his wife that he was stepping out with a friend and would return within an hour. When he failed to return and stopped responding to calls and messages, his concerned wife contacted their children in the US. Using location-tracking technology on their father’s iPhone, the children identified his last known location on the outskirts of Garodiya village. Acting on this information, family members rushed to the spot around 9 am, where they found Patel’s body with severe injuries to the head, back, and face. The Bopal police were immediately informed and reached the scene. Preliminary investigations revealed that Patel had been brutally attacked with a stone near the road, and his body was dragged into nearby bushes. His body was found near the village boundary, prompting police and forensic teams to secure the area for evidence collection. A police official said, ""Patel’s children live in the US, and he and his wife often visit them. He had returned to India two months ago for the festive season and had remained an active land broker post-retirement. He has two bungalows in Ahmedabad, one in Hebatpur and the other in Sarkhej, He was staying in his Hebatpur residence when the incident took place.” Investigators revealed that Patel had met Vaghela to discuss a potential land deal. Vaghela, who had previously loaned Patel ₹61 lakh for a property deal in Sarkhej, was reportedly upset as Patel had failed to share the promised profits. This unresolved financial grievance led to a heated argument during their meeting at Akalpya Farm, as confirmed by SP Om Prakash Jat. “The dispute escalated during their conversation. In a fit of rage, Vaghela attacked Patel with an iron rod, fatally striking him on the head,” said Jat. Post the attack, Vaghela hid Patel’s body in nearby bushes and fled the scene in Patel’s car. He later abandoned the vehicle at a hotel on Sanand-Viramgam Road and returned to his home. Based on evidence collected from the crime scene, call detail records, and CCTV footage, police quickly identified Vaghela as the prime suspect. During interrogation, Vaghela confessed to the crime.",ahmedabad

The fire caused widespread panic as flames spread from the 8th floor to the 22nd floor of the flat’s ‘M’ tower, trapping hundreds of residents. Over 230 people were successfully rescued by the fire brigade personnel. Six persons are currently undergoing treatment. The fire began around 10.30pm in the electrical duct on the 8th floor and rapidly spread vertically, engulfing multiple flats and causing extensive damage. The exact cause of the fire remains unknown. Preliminary investigations suggest potential causes, including an electrical short circuit, a firecracker, or a diya. Emergency services, including Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Service officials, Bopal police personnel, and paramedics, responded swiftly. A total of 46 fire personnel, including the chief fire officer and additional chief fire officer, were deployed to manage the situation. Using water cannons and specialised rescue equipment, firefighters managed to bring the blaze under control by 12.45 am, though the cooling process continued until 3.45 am. Residents trapped on the upper floors were evacuated through a coordinated effort. Blocks N and M, which share a common terrace, provided an evacuation route for many. Several residents suffered breathing difficulties due to smoke inhalation, with elderly individuals particularly affected. Among the casualties was a 64-year-old woman, Meenaben Kamleshbhai Shah, who tragically succumbed to severe burn injuries while being taken to the hospital. Of the 19 people hospitalised, 17 were initially treated at Saraswati Hospital, where 11 received outpatient treatment. Six individuals, including four women, one man, and a child, remain hospitalised. Others were shifted to Sola Civil Hospital and CIMS Hospital. Dr Haresh Gohil, Superintendent of Saraswati Hospital, said, “Shah was brought dead to the hospital. Currently, three patients are stable and have been moved to the general ward, while three remain under observation in the ICU. None of the patients have burn injuries; they are suffering from internal damage caused by smoke inhalation, which has affected their lungs and throat. They are expected to recover soon with proper treatment.” The fire caused extensive damage to the affected flats, destroying walls, ceilings, furniture, and other valuables. A resident of the 18th floor recounted the terrifying experience: “My family and I woke up to the smell of smoke and the sound of neighbours screaming for help. We were trapped in our flat for over an hour as the smoke thickened. The fire rescue team eventually saved us and evacuated us safely. It was a horrifying ordeal, and we feel fortunate to have survived.” “Displaced residents of the M Block were provided temporary accommodation at the society’s clubhouse, while police officers were stationed on each floor to ensure safety and assist residents in retrieving their essential belongings. Additional arrangements, including tea, snacks, and buses from the Makarba Police Headquarters, were made to support the affected families,” said Bopal Police Inspector B T Gohil. Local residents revealed that this was the third fire incident at Iscon Platinum, with previous fires reported in the M Block and B Block. The fire department and police have launched an investigation into the incident, and the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team has been called to determine the exact cause of the fire. The victim’s body has been sent for post-mortem examination. This tragic incident underscores the importance of fire safety measures and the need for stringent enforcement in residential complexes to prevent such disasters in the future.

The show will be held at the world’s largest cricket stadium – the Narendra Modi Stadium. The waiting room on the booking site, BookMyShow, opened at 11 am. A message was displayed on the site stating that users would be placed in queue once the ticket sales were live. It also mentioned that the queue position would be determined by an automated randomisation system. Importantly, waiting longer in the waiting room would not guarantee a better position in the queue. Additionally, users could book a maximum of 4 tickets per person for the Coldplay Ahmedabad show. Many people entered the waiting room as early as 11 am, and as soon as the ticket sales went live at 12 noon, they were placed in the queue. However, some users were placed in long queues with positions like 242270, 438744, and 592908. Within the first 10 minutes of the tickets going live, the South Premium Center Bay 2 (priced at ₹12,500) – the highest-priced ticket on BookMyShow – was sold out. Similarly, the tickets  priced at ₹4,500 were also sold out in the same short time. As the tickets went live, black market sales started almost immediately on another online platform. Surge pricing was observed, with the South Premium tickets now being resold for as high as ₹1,39,821, up from the original price of ₹12,450. This pattern had been observed at earlier concert shows, where black market sites began reselling tickets with inflated prices, reaching up to ₹2 lakh. Is this a new business trend? Will people continue to do this? It seems that the fan has no chance of purchasing tickets before they are sold out, simply because the black market is scooping them up so quickly. How are they able to get these tickets so early? And is the official ticketing partner planning to take any action against this? Only time and authorities will tell. Notably, the band has added an additional show on January 26, the tickets for which went live at 1 pm.

"MICA student death: Accused not cooperating, says police",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/mica-student-death-accused-not-cooperating-says-police,2024-11-17,17,11,2024,"The police constable arrested in the MICA student murder case, who was nabbed in Punjab and brought to Ahmedabad, is not cooperating with the police during interrogation, as he is aware of all the legal proceedings, alleged police. Virendrasinh Padhiyar, the constable arrested in connection with the MICA student murder case, was presented before the court by the police, who requested a 14-day remand for him. The prosecution argued before the court that Padhiyar has been serving as a police constable for the past 15 years and is well-versed in police procedures. They informed the court that he has become rigid and is not cooperating with the police at all. Custodial interrogation is crucial to understanding key details of the case, such as the type of knife used by the accused and to seize the clothes he wore during the crime. Authorities are also determining the route Padhiyar took when he went to Punjab, where he stayed, and what he did during that time. Additionally, they need to know if anyone accompanied him in committing the crime. Moreover, Padhiyar claims he used only one knife during the attack. However, the victim’s friend, who was present at the scene, states that two knives were used. The police also need to determine who Padhiyar spoke to after the crime, and whether anyone else was aware of the crime. Given these unanswered questions, the prosecution argued that a 14-day remand was necessary. However, the court granted a 10-day remand for Padhiyar. Notably, the police will also be reviewing CCTV footage from Ahmedabad to Punjab, tracking the accused’s movements along the route and gathering footage from key locations he visited.

"Vegetable vendor shot at shop in Ahmedabad, dies during treatment",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/vegetable-vendor-shot-at-shop-in-ahmedabad-dies-during-treatment,2024-11-17,17,11,2024,"A 65-year-old vegetable vendor, Badamji Chamnaji Modi, was fatally shot in a suspected case of old enmity near the Borana Vegetable Market in Ahmedabad’s Nehrunagar on Saturday night. Despite being rushed to the hospital, Modi succumbed to his injuries early Sunday morning. The attack, which took place around 8 pm, saw two unidentified assailants arrive on a motorcycle. The pillion approached Modi, who was at his shop and fired a single shot at close range, injuring him near the ear. After the attack, the shooter fled towards his accomplice on the motorcycle, and the duo escaped. Although a passerby attempted to intercept the assailants, they managed to flee. Witnesses reported that the attacker initially fired a shot into the air, creating panic in the vicinity, before targeting Modi. CCTV footage captured the suspects fleeing the scene, which is now being analysed by police teams. Modi, originally from Sihori in Rajasthan, owned a vegetable shop in Ahmedabad. He was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital, but doctors confirmed his death around 7:15 am on Sunday due to excessive blood loss. Police investigation underway Police officials have launched an intensive investigation into the case. B D Jhilariya, Inspector of Ellisbridge Police Station, stated, “A single shot was fired, and a case has been registered. We are investigating all possible angles, including a history of disputes involving the victim.” Senior officers, including JCP (Sector 1) Neeraj Badgujar, DCP (Zone 7) Shivam Verma, DCP Crime Ajit Rajian, and ACP Crime Bharat Patel, visited the crime scene on Saturday night. Authorities are relying on CCTV footage and both technical and human intelligence to identify the perpetrators. JCP Neeraj Badgujar revealed that the incident might be linked to a long-standing land dispute involving Modi’s family. “Preliminary findings suggest that someone from Rajasthan could be connected to this attack. This does not appear to be the work of an active gang in Ahmedabad,” he said. A history of attacks This is not the first time the Modi family has been targeted. In 2023, Badamji’s elder brother, Khetaram Modi, was strangled to death in Rajasthan’s Mandwad village. The case remains unsolved, with the accused still at large. In October 2024, Badamji was attacked on Manekbag Road in Ahmedabad by an assailant armed with a sharp weapon. Though he escaped with minor injuries, police were unable to apprehend the attacker, as the motorcycle used in the incident had no licence plate. Police officials disclosed that the motorcycle used in the latest attack was a Hero Splendor with an out-of-state registration. Senior officers noted that the vehicle used in the October incident was different, indicating the involvement of multiple perpetrators or groups. The police are now focusing on resolving the long-pending cases linked to the Modi family while intensifying efforts to nab the assailants responsible for Saturday’s fatal attack.

Another patient operated at Khyati Hospital dies after 11 days of surgery,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/another-patient-operated-at-khyati-hospital-dies-after-11-days-of-surgery,2024-11-17,17,11,2024,"Yet another patient died 11 days after surgery at Khyati Hospital in Ahemedabad, Gujarat, implicated in allegations involving the treatment of patients under the PM-JAY without their consent, using free medical camps as a cover to earn money. Ganpat Valand, a native of Bajana village of Vinayakpura in Kadi, had participated in the free camp organised by Khyati Hospital in his village. The doctors advised Valand to undergo surgery saying that one of the vessels in his heart was blocked. Even though his wife refused the surgery, the doctors performed the angioplasty operation, informing them that there would be no charge for the treatment under the PM-JAY card. However, Valand died after 11 days of treatment as his health deteriorated after the surgery, and his family filed a complaint with the local police regarding the same. About seven people including Valand were asked by the attending doctor at the village camp to visit Khyati Hospital for further examination. Angioplasty was performed on Valand and his health later deteriorated. The doctors on duty referred him to a public hospital in Ahmedabad for treatment. It was reportedly revealed that the surgery was the cause of Valand's worsening health, and the family therefore filed a case with local police. According to the family, the police did not investigate the matter, otherwise, more lives could have been saved. Valand breathed his last on November 4, and a complaint was filed by his family on November 15. In the complaint, Valand’s wife Laxmi, his son-in-law Kalpesh, and other relatives alleged negligence by the doctors at Khyati Hospital. According to the complaint, Valand died after a surgery he did not need, only performed to gain government money under the PM-JAY.

Now, another patient has alleged that his father, operated on by Dr Prashant Vazirani, lost his life after multiple angioplasty surgeries were conducted on him. In his complaint, Labhu Solanki, a resident of Dhandhuka taluka’s Ratanpur village, mentioned that he brought his father to an Ahmedabad-based hospital for a general checkup on October 30. There, Dr Vazirani recommended he undergo angiography. It further adds, “The doctor reacted to the angiography report, stating that uncle’s three ducts were blocked, for which two stents will have to be placed. He then stated that failing to conduct a timely surgery may pose a risk to his life.” The complainant argued that his father regularly worked as a farmer and did not possess any such issues in the past. He asked Vazirani to prescribe them a few medicines, as they wished to ponder over this option. However, Vazirani was adamant about placing the stents on an immediate basis, deeming the case as an emergency, Solanki alleged. He went on to argue, “You are not required to make the payment. I am conducting this operation through the Ayushman Card (Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana - AB-PMJAY). I will also immediately get the approval for the same, so that uncle’s life is not at risk anymore.” Two stents were placed in Solanki’s father on October 31, after which he developed complications as soon as he was brought back home. The complainant adds that they reached out to the hospital once again on November 8 as his health further deteriorated. A doctor present at the hospital, after a brief conversation with Vazirani, stated that the patient would require another stent to be placed. After this, the doctor conducted a 1.5-hour-long operation, and the patient was admitted to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). Meanwhile, the family was barred from even meeting him. After this, around 10 pm, the doctor called the family in the ICU and declared the patient dead. In his complaint, Solanki alleges that utter negligence and greed for making money caused the death of his father. He further accused, “Vazirani replicated his ‘heinous deeds’ on my father.”",ahmedabad

The attack, which occurred on the night of November 17 near Rajwadi tea shop in Kagdapith sparked huge protests by residents outside the Kagdapith police station for alleged inaction. The deceased, Alpesh Thakor, and his cousin Mahesh Thakor were ambushed by a gang wielding swords and iron rods. Among the accused are Jignesh Sharma, Vishal Chunara, Viraj alias Billo Chunara, and a 17-year-old minor, all residents of Kantodiavas near Raipur Darwaja. Alpesh succumbed to his injuries shortly after being admitted to the hospital, while Mahesh is undergoing treatment for severe wounds. Prelude to violence The attack appears to have stemmed from a prior complaint lodged by Alpesh Thakor against Jignesh Sharma over a personal dispute. According to the police, the main accused and his accomplices confronted Alpesh and Mahesh near the tea stall. An argument escalated into violence, with the accused launching a brutal assault with weapons. ACP Yuvrajsinh Gohil said, “The attackers conspired in advance to attack Alpesh, likely to be a retaliation for the complaint he filed two days ago. While two of the accused, including the minor, have been arrested, efforts are underway to apprehend the remaining suspects.” Bootlegging angle under investigation Police sources revealed that Jignesh Sharma and his associates are suspected bootleggers with multiple prohibition-related cases registered against them. Although the complaint filed by Alpesh was reportedly unrelated to bootlegging, authorities suspect that the incident may have deeper ties to illicit liquor trade activities in the area. “We are investigating every angle, including the bootlegging connection. So far, no direct prohibition-related complaints have been received from the victim or others in this matter,” said ACP Gohil. Protests erupt over police inaction The incident ignited outrage among residents. On Monday, hundreds of protestors, including the victim’s family, gathered at the Kagadapith police station, demanding stricter action against the bootleggers and accusing the police of negligence. The protest turned tense, prompting police to resort to lathi-charge to disperse the crowd after attempts to calm the situation failed. To address public anger, Kagadapith Police Inspector S A Patel issued a written assurance to the protestors, pledging to enforce strict prohibition measures in the area. However, the move was seen by many as too little, too late. Police inspector suspended In a significant development, Ahmedabad Commissioner G S Malik ordered the suspension of Inspector S A Patel for failing to act promptly on Alpesh Thakor’s earlier complaint.",ahmedabad
Nephew arranged contract killing of Ahmedabad vegetable vendor for ₹25 lakh,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/nephew-arranged-contract-killing-of-ahmedabad-vegetable-vendor-for-inr-25-lakh,2024-11-18,18,11,2024,"The Ellisbridge police with assistance of Ahmedabad Crime Branch, cracked the murder of vegetable vendor Badamji Modi in Nehrunagar. Modi was shot dead at Nehrunagar’s Borana vegetable shop on November 16. Investigation has found that the murder was executed by contract killers hired by the deceased’s nephew. The killers were hired for a sum of ₹25 lakh. With the help of CCTV footage of the surrounding areas and human intelligence, accused Kuldeep Parmar (22) and Ankit Bhadoria (21), both from Bhind, Madhya Pradesh, and Annu Rajput (24), from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, were arrested within 48 hours of the incident. All three were employed as fruit loaders at the Naroda Fruit Market and lived in Ahmedabad's Memco area. The fourth accused, Ashok Khetaram Modi (alias Marwari), the victim’s nephew, was found to have orchestrated the entire plot. Sources said that Ashok, who had a working relationship with the accused, provided them with the weapon and the motorcycle used in the murder. He had paid them an advance of ₹75,000 out of the ₹25 lakh contract for execution of the crime. “After the killing, the assailants fled the scene on their motorcycle and made their way to Kalupur Railway Station. As trains were unavailable, they travelled to Rajasthan by bus, before reaching Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh. The Crime Branch team tracked them down and arrested them in Ratlam, bringing them back to Ahmedabad,” said a senior crime branch police officer. Further interrogation revealed that Ashok Modi had long harboured animosity towards his uncle, likely motivated by land disputes. It was also found that a dispute of land worth ₹2.5 crore was ongoing between Ashok’s father Khetaram and Badamji. For the past two months, the accused had been analysing the entire routine of the victim before plotting the attack. A history of attacks This is not the first time the Modi family has been targeted. In 2023, Badamji’s elder brother, Khetaram Modi, was strangled to death in Rajasthan’s Mandwad village. The case remains unsolved, with the accused still at large. Khetaram was Ashok’s father. Ashok had suspicion that Badamji had killed his father over the land dispute between the families. In October 2024, Badamji was attacked on Manekbaug Road in Ahmedabad by an assailant armed with a sharp weapon. Though he escaped with minor injuries, police were unable to apprehend the attacker, as the bike used in the incident had no licence plate.

Five individuals have been arrested in connection with thefts that targeted catalytic converters for their valuable metal content. Acting on specific intelligence, the SOG intercepted a car and a van near Balaji Hotel in Vasna. The suspects were found in possession of nine stolen Tata company silencers, five mobile phones, and two vehicles used in their operations. The arrested individuals have been identified as Sanjay Bijalbhai Parmar (31) and Riyaz Pathan (25), both residents of Sanand, Mohammad Danish (18) from Viramgam, and brothers Sabbir Ashiq Ali and Kamil Ashiq Ali, also from Viramgam.

Sanjay Parmar, a driver for Rao Travels, and Riyaz Pathan, an employee at Tata Motors, played key roles in the operation. Exploiting their positions, they removed silencers from vehicles under the guise of routine maintenance. The stolen silencers were handed over to Sabbir and Kamil Ali, who transported them to Viramgam for resale. The silencers, stolen from the Tata Motors manufacturing plant in Sanand, contained catalytic converters made from precious metals such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium.

The accused, Hasmukh Modi, Chetan Makwana, Chintan Solanki, and Mahesh Rathod were accused of ganging up to rob money from a young man in 2023. Public Prosecutor Ajit Trivedi stated that on January 14, 2023, the four accused stopped Rahul Thakor near the Nava Vadaj Rabari Vasahat over a trivial matter of not lending a motorcycle. They robbed him of ₹2,000 and assaulted him with swords and knives, causing serious injuries. A minor was also involved in this crime and is likely to be tried under juvenile justice laws. Trivedi drew the attention of the court to the recent surge in crimes in the city and incidents of people attacking each other with deadly weapons over trivial matters. It is necessary to curb and control such incidents, the prosecutor said. The court should impose a sentence that sets an example for such criminals and instils fear of the law in people with a criminal mindset. Considering the arguments, the court sentenced all accused to ten years of imprisonment. Also read: Crime city Ahmedabad! 9 murders in 20 days raise alarms",ahmedabad

Under this scheme, all government and government-aided schools in the state are required to submit an online proposal on behalf of the eligible students. However, last year (2023-24), 82 rural and urban schools in Ahmedabad failed to submit these proposals, preventing the eligible girls from benefiting from the program. The eligibility criteria for the scheme are based on the family’s annual income, which is capped at ₹47,000 annually for residents of rural areas and ₹68,000 for those in urban areas. According to reports, there are often numerous complaints related to this scheme, as thousands of bicycles remain unused each year. Amid these concerns, the district deputy director’s office of the Developing Castes Welfare department informed the District Education Officer (DEO) of rural and urban Ahmedabad that 82 schools had not filed proposals for the year 2023-24. As a result, the DEO has instructed all the schools to submit a proposal offline within seven days. While every school was required to submit online proposals through a digital portal annually, this offline submission has now been mandated for the current year. Among the 82 schools that failed to submit the proposals, three are located in Dholka, one in Balva, two in Viramgam, two in Mandal, 16 in Daskroi, and 59 in Ahmedabad city. Due to the negligence of these schools, many underprivileged and middle-class students in class 9 were deprived of bicycles last year. Therefore, the DEO has requested that the schools submit their proposals promptly, so the process of providing bicycles to students can begin this year.

SOG arrested five during this raid, while complaints were filed against seven. In a late-night raid on Tuesday at Elephanta Society near a Jain temple in Naranpura, SOG seized the drugs from the residence of Jignesh Pandya. SOG Deputy Commissioner Jayrajsinh Vala had an intel that Mustakim Sheikh, a resident of Fatehwadi area, was involved in drug peddling. He was getting drug supplies from Mohammad Khan, a resident of Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh, and was keeping them at Jignesh Pandya’s apartment in Naranpura. Based on this information, the police raided the apartment and arrested Mohammad Khan, Mustakim Sheikh, Dhruv Patel, Mohammad Sheikh, and Abrar Khan Pathan. Preliminary investigation revealed that the apartment owner, Pandya, was also a drug peddler. He would provide his apartment as a meeting place for drug deals. SOG is further investigating the case. A seizure of 93,691 kilograms of drugs, 2,229 litres of liquid drugs, and 73,163 drug pills and injections have been seized in Gujarat in the last five years, indicating a larger problem that the ‘dry state’ is dealing with.

"Gujarat leaders preach big, practice little, talk of train travel, but take the flight",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-leaders-preach-big-practice-little-talk-of-train-travel-but-take-the-flight,2024-11-22,22,11,2024,"The plan by Gujarat chief minister, ministers, and IAS officers to travel to Somnath by train seems to be a hoax. Despite all the talk about addressing people’s issues through ordinary travel, the ministers and IAS officers opted to travel by plane instead. The three-day ‘Gir Chintan Shibir’ began in Somnath on Thursday, with discussions on increasing employment opportunities, boosting rural incomes, government schemes, and the role of local self-government institutions in tourism development. And to address the problems the chief minister had travelled to Somnath. While the people of Gujarat are suffering from issues like rising inflation and unemployment, there are several pressing concerns, including the exploitation of poor patients in hospitals, fake officers, corruption and fraud in government offices, and the growing menace of alcohol and drugs. Recently, villagers in Somnath have been raising concerns about the ‘eco zone’ issue, but the government has shown no interest in resolving this problem. Crime rates, including murders and rapes, are rising, and the growing number of issues has led to severe criticism of the government. In the past, ministers used to sit in the secretariat and show interest in resolving the public’s issues. Now, ministers hardly ever visit the secretariat, and the number of visitors has drastically reduced. Under these circumstances, a plan was made that the chief minister, ministers, and IAS officers would travel to Somnath by train. However on Thursday, ministers and IAS officers boarded a flight from Ahmedabad airport to Keshod and then travelled to Somnath by car. If these ministers and officials had travelled by road from Gandhinagar to Somnath, they would have faced the traffic problems and poor road conditions first hand, and they would have understood the reality of Gujarat’s infrastructure. The ministers deliberately avoided road travel to avoid facing any problems during the journey. Furthermore, they are not interested in addressing the issue or making any efforts to resolve it. Only the citizens of the state suffer; the leaders do not have to face these issues as they simply avoid them by travelling by air. Earlier in October, Gujarat’s Minister of Energy and Petrochemicals reportedly travelled to an event by both train and air, as the roads from Ahmedabad to Junagadh were in a dilapidated condition.

"Air pollution prime cause of prolonged coughing, could cause COPD: experts",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/health/air-pollution-prime-cause-of-prolonged-coughing-could-cause-copd-say-experts,2024-11-22,22,11,2024,"Air pollution The rising pollution levels across the country have caused devastation for those with breathing issues and respiratory complications. The number of cases of prolonged cough has seen a stark jump following the plummeting air quality. Several medical experts have opined that such prolonged coughing problems could lead to chronic lung diseases, and should not be undermined. The experts attribute these coughing cases to the smoke and dust following the Diwali festival, as well as the unattended air pollution from vehicles. Numbers from pulmonologists suggest that out of the total 25 patients arriving in the outpatient department (OPD), an average of 20 suffer from such coughing issues. Doctors at Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad’s Sola suggest that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is common among cigarette smokers. However, as the air quality has dipped down significantly, and COPD is spreading among the population exponentially. Chemical pollution caused by industrial emissions also becomes a major factor behind COPD. Only trailing behind heart disease and cancer, COPD is the third largest disease on the planet. Commonly misinterpreted as a cause of ageing, COPD’s symptoms such as formation of sputum and shortness of breath, are rarely observed in the initial stages. The prevalence of COPD in India is between 5.5% and 7.5%. A recent study found that the prevalence of COPD is higher in men (22%) compared to women (19%).",ahmedabad

The attack occurred late on November 19 and extended into the early hours of November 20. Akash Diwakar was assaulted with sticks and sharp objects by the accused in Gokulnagar. The complaint was lodged by the victim’s Brother Vishal Diwakar, who stated in his complaint that caste-based slurs were hurled during the assault. The victim, grievously injured, succumbed to his wounds in the early hours of Friday while undergoing treatment at a local hospital. According to police officials, the attack stemmed from a six-month-old dispute between the accused and the victim. The accused, identified as Sonusingh Tomar (32), Shekhar Singh Tomar, and Yogesh Mathur (35), allegedly held a grudge against Akash over a prior altercation. On Tuesday night, the accused, already present in the Gokulnagar area, instigated a fight when Akash arrived. They insulted him, provoked a confrontation, and subsequently attacked him with sticks and a sharp object before fleeing the scene. A team was formed by Krishnanagar police to trace the accused, leading to their arrest on Thursday afternoon. The police also seized the weapons used in the attack as part of the investigation. The accused, Sonusingh Tomar and Shekhar Singh Tomar, residents of Thakkarnagar, and Yogesh Mathur, a resident of Krishnanagar, are currently in police custody. Further investigation is underway to determine the precise sequence of events and establish additional motives behind the crime.

Dream home in Ahmedabad to get expensive with increase in jantri prices,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/dream-home-in-ahmedabad-to-get-expensive-ahead-of-revised-jantri-prices,2024-11-22,22,11,2024,"The recent announcement of jantri revision in Gujarat is set to send property prices soaring, which some estimate as high as 100-200% by 2025. The cost of purchasing FSI (Floor Space Index) is also going to increase for builders and developers. FSI is a parameter in real estate and construction that determines the maximum built-up area that can be constructed on a plot of land. Currently, builders pay 30% extra for FSI in areas where the jantri rate is ₹15,000 per square yard. However, with the implementation of the new jantri, they will have to pay double or even triple the amount. This will lead to an increase in the prices of houses for common citizens and commercial properties. Due to this increase, there is a possibility of an increase in the rates for purchasing FSI. Today, the jantri rates for Shela are around ₹30,000 to ₹40,000. In the new proposed jantri, the rates for areas in Shela will reach between ₹70,000 and ₹76,000 or even above ₹1 lakh. As a result, there is a possibility of a 100% increase in the rates for purchasing FSI in this area. There are 39 TP areas in Thaltej. The jantri rate ranged from ₹40,000 to ₹70,000. In the new proposed jantri, the rates for Thaltej can go up to ₹76,000 to ₹1,00,000. A big difference is being seen in the rates between TP areas and non-TP areas in the same locality.

In the remand petition for Vazirani, submitted before the Ahmedabad Rural Court on Thursday, the Ahmedabad Crime Branch states that an angiography chart was missing from the files of a few patients. Moreover, the coronary angioplasty and angiography reports of the two deceased patients were found to be bogus in the police investigation. Such acts indicate systematic economic fraud in the entire case, stated the police petition. It has been uncovered that the hospital secured public money by forging documents, through which it undertook unnecessary angiography and angioplasties. After the completion of Vazirani’s seven-day remand, the crime branch officials had sought his custody  for another seven days. The court approved his remand for four days. Notably, additional public prosecutor Vijay Barot stated, “During the search conducted at the hospital, it was found that the accused had affixed stamps indicating information regarding the designation and registration on the files. These stamps have not been recovered from the hospital. So, where are these stamps? Who developed these stamps? Files of a few patients have missing angiography charts. So, who has the original angiography charts? The accused should be kept under remand and interrogated.” “An investigation needs to be conducted to trace the computer on which the bogus reports were created and on which printer they were printed,” Barot added. He further mentioned, “Two mobile phones of the accused have been seized in this case. His call and WhatsApp data need to be analysed. Where did the accused procure the stents for the deceased? For whom did the accused perform angiographies and angioplasties? This entire conspiracy is pre-planned, and an investigation needs to be done to find out how.” The entire row stirred up following the death of two patients from Kadi after doctors at Khyati hospital allegedly conducted an angioplasty on them to benefit from Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY (Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana).

The sarpanch was suspended on September 21, 2022, after an FIR was filed on September 13, 2022, under Prevention of Corruption Act by Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB), Godhra Police Station. According to an oral order by the court, the suspension order on September 21 was passed by District Development Officer (DDO), which was challenged by the petitioner. However, it was rejected by the appellate authority by placing reliance on provision of section 59(1) of the Act, 1993, on April 21, 2023. Justice Mauna Bhatt of high court observed that since both these orders were passed by the same authority i.e. by Arjunsinh B Rathod, IAS, it was a breach of principles of natural justice, deserving an interference of the court. Therefore, the court quashed the order passed on April 21, 2023. The court, without getting into merits of the appeal, directed the Additional Development Commissioner (ADC), Gandhinagar, to take appropriate decision in accordance with the law within two weeks.

As per the SOP, the construction waste must be disposed of in designated plots. Those violating the rule will face fines ranging from ₹25,000 to ₹1 lakh. AMC has identified 25 plots across 7 zones in the city for the collection and recycling of construction waste. Citizens are required to transport their construction waste to these designated plots at their own expense. However, there will be no charge from the AMC for depositing waste at these plots. If citizens are unable to transport the waste themselves, they can contact the CCRS (Comprehensive Complaint Redressal System) at 155303 to request a pickup, for which they will have to pay a fee. This rule will apply to all construction projects in the city, whether government or private. To monitor cleanliness and ensure no demolition waste is left on the streets, special squads will be deployed in the 7 zones of the city. Additionally, after work on roads for gas connections, electricity, telephone lines, etc., approved by the engineering department, service provider agencies will have to ensure that no soil or debris remains on the roads.

Deputy City Engineer Jignesh Shah provided an update stating: “Yes, the matter is sub judice in the court, but currently, hearings for other cases are ongoing. We haven’t received any orders regarding the same. Therefore, we have just started the construction of the service road for now.” What is the case in the High Court? Amit Panchal filed a revised petition against the construction of the Panjrapole flyover in Ahmedabad on August 5. The petition in the Gujarat High Court raised the following issues with the construction of the Panjrapole flyover: There is no need for a flyover from Panjrapole Cross Road to IIM because there is already one flyover. The construction of this flyover will result in the felling of old trees, which is unacceptable from an environmental perspective. This entire area is green cover. Ahmedabad has already lost 48% of its green cover since 2011. Traffic on this road has decreased by 15% in 2020 compared to 2012, eliminating the need for the flyover. The Ranjit Buildcon company, which has been awarded the contract to build this bridge, has a poor track record. Allowing the construction of such a bridge solely for the purpose of earning profits for the contractor company at the expense of the environment cannot be permitted.

Justice Sandeep Bhatt has warned the CID Crime, saying, “Why does the CID Crime have so much interest in this case? Or do some officials have a special interest? CID Crime was not created for settling disputes and conflicts, but for investigating specific purposes and special crimes. CID Crime is not a recovery agent.” Gujarat HC expressed serious displeasure over the CID Crime’s conduct in handling investigations and said that in many cases involving CID Crime investigations have come to the court’s attention, leading the high court to issue a stern warning. The high court stated that if such instances continue to come to their attention, they will take strict action. During the hearing, the judge asked the name of CID Crime Additional Directorate General, Rajkumar Pandian. The Gujarat HC asked CID Crime to present a statement. What was the land dispute case? A land dispute case of Surat involving transactions from 2007, has seen extensive legal proceedings with multiple petitions and investigations pending in various courts. The accused sought to either transfer the investigation from CID Crime to another agency or to quash the related proceedings. Earlier, the HC directed the accused to cooperate with the investigation while granting relief from arrest, but the complainant subsequently obtained a stay order against this decision from the Supreme Court. Amid these developments, the HC criticised CID Crime for its undue haste and approach during the investigation, reflecting the contentious nature of the case. Also read:",ahmedabad

The incident, witnessed by horrified onlookers, ended after the vehicle crashed into a railing. Eyewitnesses reported that the driver, later identified as Ripal Panchal, a resident of Thaltej, appeared heavily intoxicated and nonchalant about the chaos he had caused. Shockingly, after the series of accidents, he was seen sitting inside his damaged car and smoking a cigarette. The onlookers thrashed him for his deeds before handing him to M division traffic police. The rampage began when the Audi first collided with a Harrier SUV near the ISKCON Bridge. The driver continued recklessly, hitting a three-wheeler and another car before crashing into a Nexon near a Tata Motors dealership. The Audi finally came to a halt after striking a barricade, leaving multiple vehicles severely damaged. Victim Ronica Patil, who was driving the Nexon hit by Panchal, said, “I was on my way to the office when the Audi hit my car, causing me to lose control and crash into the divider. The driver appeared so drunk that he was oblivious to the damage he had caused. After the crash, he sat in the car smoking and then attempted to drive further, colliding with more vehicles.” Krunal Patel, another victim of the rampage, said, “I had parked my outside Tata Motors when I heard the noise of the accident. When I rushed towards the spot the Audi driver was dragging the Nexon car to the divided and finally colliding with the barricades outside the showroom. The driver was highly intoxicated.” Bystanders, angered by the driver’s audacity, chased down the car and managed to stop it after its final collision. Despite being apprehended, witnesses claimed he continued to exhibit signs of intoxication. CCTV footage of the incidents show the Audi’s erratic driving and the widespread damage caused by the reckless spree. The police have taken Panchal into custody, and further investigation is underway to determine the extent of his intoxication and other circumstances surrounding the accident. The M division of police have nabbed the accused in the matter and further investigation is on.

Thakor has only studied till Class 10, as per the investigation. Thakor is now facing serious charges of executing an adoption with a fake birth certificate of a premature infant, and monetary fraud. During the three-day remand by the police, it was revealed that Thakor had sought ₹1.20 lakh from a couple, Nirav Modi and his wife, for adoption of a child he claimed was an orphan, and had procured a fake birth certificate from Radhanpur Municipality. However, the couple later found out that the infant had a condition that led to fluid buildup in its head. The couple went to Thakor and demanded their money back, willing to ‘return’ the child. Thakor told the couple that they would get only ₹40,000 back, and took away the adoption papers. The couple then filed a complaint against Thakor at the Patan B Division police station. According to Dr Divyesh Shah of Nishka Hospital in Patan, the infant was brought to the hospital twice, and the parents' names were different both the times. “First, the parents’ names were filled as Thakor and his wife, and later, it was Nirav Modi and his wife,” the doctor said.

Sources reveal that the superiors have offered protection to these employees. The contract renewal files were submitted with the remarks, “An advertisement will be issued for new recruitment, and the recruitment process will be carried out as per the rules.” This was a clear refusal to renew the contracts of these employees.

"Ahmedabad spits 9 crore tobacco sprays everyday, finds study",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-spits-9-crore-tobacco-sprays-everyday-finds-study,2024-11-26,26,11,2024,"Spitting menace Ahmedabad A silent epidemic that has chewed upon and engulfed Ahmedabad as a whole is the spitting menace prevalent among tobacco eaters. The research titled ‘Daily Tobacco Consumption in Adults of Ahmedabad’, conducted by a private university has deduced a probability of the city housing around 30 lakh consumers of edible tobacco products (paan and gutkha). The study was conducted on 882 people of age groups varying from 15 to 94, who are hooked on consuming the product in the city. Usually, the study states, 90% of the spitters disseminate the filth from their mouths in intervals of 10 minutes. However, this number could vary on a person-to-person basis. The study also finds that a tobacco eater consumes ten packets in a day and spits it out thrice in one consumption, translating to 30 spits from an individual every day. This number coils up to 9 crore daily spits splashed across various parts of the city. 25% of these spitters use the walls of the city’s buildings, staircase corners, and urinals, among other spots, to disperse the waste. The Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC), however, claims to be rigorously monitoring the ‘spit situation’. AMC has devised strict vigilance over such acts through a network of CCTV cameras. However, the issue of offenders evading the corporation’s eagle eyes and violating the norms in public spaces remains unattended. A well-known physician in Ahmedabad adds their opinion on this issue, stating, “People who consume tobacco products (paan masala and gutkha) tend to spit more frequently. Such addictions find shelter where an individual seeks some sort of mental stimulation at regular intervals. As they consume tobacco, their salivary glands become active, filling their mouths with saliva, eventually forcing them to spit.” Further adding to their statement, they opine, “Earlier, when washbasins were not common, spittoons were kept in public places and even at houses. Although spitting publicly is illegal now, people continue to spit in public places without any control over themselves.” The study establishes that an individual residing in the slums is more likely to spit in public spaces. Ramesh Purabiya, working at a public space in the city’s Sola area, states, “People find nooks and corners of government hospitals and office buildings more convenient to spit.” Purabiya attributes this liberty to the lack of authoritative vigilance in such spaces. He adds that one submerges into the depths of selfishness in such cases, unable to comprehend another’s concerns. He finds railway stations, bus stops, as well as airports suffering from the same plight.",ahmedabad

When Makasna failed to return the money, the money lenders assaulted the teacher. About eight months ago, a contractor named Jignesh Baldaniya came into contact with Sanjay Patel, the teacher. Sanjay introduced Baldaniya to Chandresh Makasna, nephew of ex-MLA of Surendranagar, who resides in Dubai. The three of them developed a strong bond over time and began lending money to each other when needed. During this time, Makasna needed ₹3.50 crore, which he procured from Baldaniya, and Kuldeep Solanki, with Sanjay as a mediator. The money was sent to Dubai via angadia. In October, Solanki and Baldaniya had asked Sanjay about the repayment. However, the money remained unpaid. On November 19, Baldaniya and Solanki called Sanjay to Maninagar, Ahmedabad, under the pretense of a business discussion, and asked him to meet them at Solanki's office. Upon arrival, Solanki and his six accomplices beat Sanjay, seized his two phones, wallet, and car, and locked him up in the office. Later, Solanki, along with his driver and an accomplice named Rocky, forced Sanjay into his own car and drove him towards Surendranagar. However, during the journey, when Solanki spoke to Baldaniya, they decided to return to Solanki’s office. By late night, Solanki again locked up Sanjay in his office and told him that the money owed by his friends had to be repaid by him. The following night, they took him to a farmhouse near Zanu village, where he was again locked up. However, Sanjay managed to escape and filed a complaint with the police. In a recent development, further investigation has revealed that Sanjay Patel, in addition to being a teacher, was also involved in business activities. He runs a business and has held a residence visa from the UAE. According to officials from the Education Department in Gandhinagar, Sanjay Patel made 33 trips to Dubai without taking the proper permissions. This revelation raises further questions about his financial dealings, especially in light of the money-lending activities. This led to his suspension from the job by the state government.

Gujarat’s anti-fraud unit turned a blind eye despite irregularities at private hospitals,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarats-anti-fraud-unit-turned-a-blind-eye-despite-irregularities-at-private-hospitals,2024-11-26,26,11,2024,"The Gujarat Health department is facing flak following the scams under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY). The responsibility for preventing irregularities under PM-JAY lies entirely with the State Anti-Fraud Unit (SAFU). Had the SAFU been vigilant, the scam could have been avoided. Questions have been raised regarding the widespread irregularities in private corporate hospitals as well as the lack of vigilance by the anti-fraud officials. Why were routine checks not conducted to prevent irregularities in hospitals under PM-JAY? The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report has stated that many hospitals in Gujarat claimed money from the Health department by falsely claiming patients under the PM-JAY scheme. It was also found that the same patient was admitted to multiple hospitals. Such irregularities were noted by the CAG, but the SAFU  in Gujarat took no action. Was the patient treated properly under the PM-JAY scheme? Were there any instances of malpractice by the hospitals? The SAFU is responsible for investigating these matters. There are reports of malpractice in a prominent hospital, where stents were unknowingly inserted into many patients. It is unacceptable that the SAFU remained unaware of such widespread malpractice. Had the anti-fraud officials conducted regular inspections at hospitals, it is likely that the exploitation of poor patients could have been stopped. Consequently, the functioning of the Anti-Fraud Unit has come under scrutiny.

Sabarmati Police Inspector H N Patel stated that “the victim and her sister were threatened with a knife by the accused, instilling fear that prevented them from speaking out initially”. “The victim, terrified of the repercussions, remained silent until Bhavsar, in a moment of carelessness, began recounting the incident to a friend. This conversation eventually reached the wider community, damaging the victim's reputation and prompting her to gather the courage to confide in her parents about the traumatic experience.” Following the complaint, the Sabarmati police acted swiftly, apprehending Bhavsar at his residence. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities emphasising their commitment to ensuring justice for the victim.",ahmedabad

The DGGI arrested the chartered accountant of Ashapura Enterprise, which belongs to Hardevsinh Jadeja, the brother of former BJP MLA of Gondal, Jayrajsinh Zala. According to preliminary reports, the accused enterprise manipulated the invoice of imported HSD. Rajkot’s Ashapura Enterprise imported a huge amount of base oil through Mundra and Kandla ports. Authorities are currently investigating the recipients of this imported oil and the end-use of the supply chain to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory norms. Embezzlement of GST worth crores have also been revealed by importing base oil from foreign countries. Raids have been conducted on various suppliers, including Rajkot, Mundra, Kandla, and others, to uncover this fraud. Base oil was being imported under the guise of high-speed diesel (HSD). This oil is primarily used in the manufacturing of industrial and automotive products, as well as engine, transmission, gear oils, hydraulic oil, brake oil, repair oil, etc. Also read : Vadodara SOG team nabs two for diesel theft Precious metals in catalytic converters drive massive silencer theft racket in Ahmedabad Kutch police nabs gang responsible for robbing 34 temples in Gujarat",ahmedabad
Gujarat govt doctors run private practice despite claiming non-practicing allowance,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-govt-doctors-run-private-practice-despite-claiming-non-practicing-allowance,2024-11-27,27,11,2024,"Gujarat Health department’s rule prohibits government-employed doctors from running private practice, but there has been blatant violation of this rule. Amid the recent revelation of scams in private hospitals, the government doctors are not far, either. The state government gives doctors a special non-practicing allowance, yet many continue to engage in private practice and receive huge pay, while the Health department reportedly turns a blind eye. As a result, government hospitals are left in a state of neglect. Doctors in government hospitals are given a non-practicing allowance of ₹20,000 to ₹30,000 per month to prevent them from working in private hospitals, yet they continue to break these rules. Doctors are making money under the guise of honorary services despite the Health department making biometric attendance mandatory for doctors to ensure their presence in government hospitals. However, despite this, many doctors reportedly spend only a few hours in the hospital and then go on to practice privately in other hospitals. The lack of action from the authority has also raised questions on the implementation of the policies by the Health department.

""An outstanding performance to secure a brilliant 8-wicket victory over Tripura CA in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy! The spotlight shines on Urvil Patel, who created history by smashing the fastest century in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy history in just 28 balls! ""His explosive knock of 113 not out off 35 balls, including 7 boundaries and 12 towering sixes, has set a new benchmark in T20 cricket! Kudos to the entire team for their spirit and determination. Let’s keep this winning momentum going,"" Gujarat Cricket Association said in an Instagram post. Urvil also broke the record held by Rishabh Pant for the fastest T20 ton by an India. Pant had hit a 32-ball hundred against Himachal Pradesh in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy back in 2018 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi. His century is now the second-fastest in men’s T20 cricket, only behind Estonia’s Sahil Chauhan, who scored a hundred off just 27 balls against Cyprus earlier this year. The 26-year-old Urvil, who recently went unsold in the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, took only 15 balls to hit his half-century and smashed seven fours and 12 sixes to eventually finish on an unbeaten 113 off 35 balls and a jaw-dropping strike-rate of 322.86. He was also aided by Aarya Desai making 38 not out from the other end as Gujarat completed the chase in just 10.2 overs to get an emphatic win in their Group B match. The wickekeeper-batter was a member of IPL 2022 champions Gujarat Titans, who had signed him for Rs 20 lakh in the 2023 auction, before releasing him ahead of the 2024 auction. Interestingly, at this very date last year, Urvil cracked the second-fastest List A ton by an Indian batter, when he hit unbeaten 41-ball 100 for Gujarat in their Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Arunachal Pradesh in Chandigarh.

However, what has particularly upset the citizens is the tedious process of getting back their four-wheelers or two-wheelers from the Regional Transport Office (RTO). To get the vehicle back, the owners have to pay a fine and get a receipt. The receipt has to be shown to the respective police station, where a note is made and the vehicle is returned to them. The memo they receive during the combing drive mentions the absence of a licence, RC book, and helmet. Based on this, the RTO officials identify faults like PUC, insurance, etc, and also collect pending fines. Due to a lack of coordination between the police and the RTO, huge crowds gather at the RTO. There are piles of two-wheelers across 60 police stations in the city, and at once, only 100 tokens are issued, leading to a delayed process for the fined owners. After getting the token, they have to pay a hefty fine of ₹3,000 to ₹6,000 at the RTO. The sluggish process means that the owners are waiting for as many as 15 days to get their vehicles back. Ahmedabad city police of seven zones, Special Operation Group, Crime Branch and Traffic Police collectively initiated combing on Monday from 7 pm to Tuesday 7 am. During the night combing operation, a total of ₹12.82 lakh was collected from 1,684 vehicle owners. Whereas, in the two nights of combing, a total of 3,000 vehicles were seized and documents submitted to RTO, according to sources. Enraged citizens complained that in some areas police did not consider digital documents and collected fines.

Man impersonating as IAS sent to three-day remand in Ahmedabad,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/man-impersonating-as-ias-sentenced-to-three-day-remand-in-ahmedabad,2024-11-27,27,11,2024,"An Ahmedabad court handed a three-day remand to an accused for impersonating an Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer and promising government jobs to gullible persons. Presenting their case in court, crime branch officials sought a 10-day remand against accused Mehul Shah. The prosecutor stated that the accused was not cooperating with the police. The investigation is still ongoing and to determine how Shah created the fake appointment letters and who else was involved in the scam, they needed the remand. Preliminary investigations have revealed that two individuals, Afazal and Yasin, were also involved in the scam, but they have not been arrested yet. The police will need more information from Shah to nab them. The extent of the scam, including how many people were tricked into paying for fake government jobs, is also still under investigation. After hearing the arguments, the court granted a three-day remand. Who is Mehul Shah and what is the fake government job scam? Mehul Shah posed as an IAS officer in Ahmedabad and duped many individuals under the pretense of offering them government jobs. He scammed job seekers by issuing counterfeit appointment letters from the District Education Officer for government clerk positions and collected lakhs of rupees in exchange. How did the scam come to light? The scam was uncovered after a complaint was filed by Pratik Shah, a car rental businessman. As per the complaint, Mehul Shah contacted him on September 6, claiming to be an IAS officer. Shah rented vehicles for 'official use' and even installed sirens, curtains in the cars. Mehul Shah later hired additional vehicles for personal use, but refused to pay the dues, switching off his phone to avoid contact, leading Pratik Shah to file a complaint.

‘Serial offender’ Ripal Panchal released on conditional bail hours after accident,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/serial-offender-ripal-panchal-released-on-conditional-bail-hours-after-accident,2024-11-27,27,11,2024,"A day after creating havoc on the Bopal-Ambli Road while driving a luxury car, Ripal Panchal was awarded conditional bail by a court on Tuesday. On Monday, the rampage began when Panchal’s Audi car first collided with a Harrier SUV near the ISKCON Bridge. The driver continued recklessly, hitting a three-wheeler and another car before crashing into a Nexon near a Tata Motors dealership. The Audi finally came to a halt after striking a barricade, leaving multiple vehicles severely damaged. After the back-to-back accidents, M Division Traffic Police filed a case against Panchal under the Motor Vehicle Act and other articles of BNS. Panchal was presented in a local court on Tuesday where the state prosecutor emphasised that the accused ‘is a serial offender of driving recklessly and irresponsibly in drunken condition’. He also argued that an accused who may cause harm to citizens should not be given bail. However, the rural court agreed on conditional bail, under which Panchal would not be allowed to drive until the charge sheet was filed. On the other hand, the police are collecting CCTV footage in this case and the FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory) has conducted a site inspection. The accused’s call details record will be obtained. The braking system of the accused’s Audi will also be checked. Blood samples of the accused have been sent to the FSL. The police will initiate the process of cancelling Panchal's license. However, after the accused was released on bail, there was some resentment among lawyers, parties involved, and the citizens. The evidence that the police will now collect is sufficient to conduct the trial, but for now, the accused has been released on conditional bail. Moreover, this accident was not the first of its kind, Ripal Panchal was involved in an accident on May 16, 2024, where he hit a person on an Activa with his Audi near Shyamal Char Rasta. The victim’s wife had suffered fractures in her ribs and leg. On September 16, he was arrested by the Bodakdev Police for driving his Jeep Compass under the influence of alcohol in a reckless manner.

A man was arrested by the Vastrapur police after he was caught in a lewd act in front of female passengers in a crowded metro coach. The incident, which occurred during the morning commute on November 27, has prompted widespread criticism and calls for stricter security measures in public transport. The incident took place on Wednesday morning on metro train TE0008 in compartment L4, which departed from Kalupur station and was heading towards Thaltej. Among the passengers in the affected coach were several women and young girls. The accused, wearing a hospital-branded T-shirt, engaged in the obscene act despite protests from fellow passengers. Some youths attempted to intervene, but the man continued his behaviour. Ankur Pathak, Metro Media Coordinator, stated, “The incident occurred between 8.30 am and 9 am. After being informed by the passenger, our security staff at the station launched a search. Using CCTV footage, we identified and tracked down the individual, who was subsequently handed over to the Vastrapur police station for further investigation.” A disturbed passenger recorded the incident on video and reported it to security personnel at the SRP post after alighting at Thaltej metro station. Acting promptly, metro security staff initiated an investigation. They apprehended the accused at Doordarshan Kendra station and handed him over to the Vastrapur police for further action. Himanshu Verma, DCP Zone 1, confirmed, “The incident occurred on Wednesday morning, and the Metro authorities handed the accused over to us on Thursday. A case has been registered against him, and further investigations are ongoing.” The Vastrapur police have registered a case and are delving into the accused's background. According to a police source, the man works as a cleaner and may be suffering from a mental illness. During interrogation, authorities observed behaviour that raised concerns about his mental health. Further investigations, including medical evaluations, are expected to shed more light on the case.” Currently, the accused's identity has not been disclosed.

Congress MLA urges for suspension of sentence for local election,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/congress-mla-urges-for-suspension-of-sentence-for-local-election,2024-11-28,28,11,2024,"Vimal Chudasama, the Congress MLA from the Somnath constituency in Gir Somnath district, appealed to the Gujarat High Court to suspend and revoke the six-month sentence imposed on him by the trial court. In his appeal, Chudasama referenced the cases of Rahul Gandhi, Navjot Singh Sidhu, and Hardik Patel. Chudasama, who intends to contest the upcoming local elections, requested the immediate suspension of his sentence, arguing that otherwise, he would be deprived of his fundamental right to contest elections. Chudasama’s legal representative argued that he has been an MLA for the past two terms and has also served as a councillor of Chorwad Municipal Corporation since 2003. Given his intention to contest upcoming elections, Chudasama requested that the court suspend his sentence, as otherwise, he would be denied his constitutional right to participate in elections. However, the state government opposed the application, arguing that the demand for suspension was legally unjustified. They claimed that it is common for people to contest elections even if they are facing sentences, and that the trial court’s decision to impose the sentence was legal and proper. Therefore, they urged the High Court not to intervene in this case. Justice M R Mengdey, after hearing the arguments from both sides, reserved his judgment in the case.

Special Judge and Ahmedabad District Judge K M Sojitra acquitted another accused, Sindhesh Kharade, due to lack of evidence. The case is being considered highly significant, as it involves an attempt to assassinate a political leader, and the court emphasised that the accused should be punished strictly under the law. In 2020, under the instructions of gangster Chhota Shakeel, a plan was devised to murder BJP leader Gordhan Zadafia. However, Gujarat ATS successfully intercepted the plan and arrested two of the accused. As per the case details, on August 19, 2020, the Gujarat ATS arrested Sheikh at the Venus Hotel on Relief Road in Ahmedabad. During the arrest, the police found a photo of Zadafia on Shaikh’s WhatsApp, along with instructions sent from a Dutch number. During the investigation, it was revealed that Shaikh was in possession of an illegal silver-coloured pistol and three live cartridges. The case was heard under the GCTOC law. The prosecution presented evidence in the special court, including 24 witnesses along with evidence, and argued that the case was severe, as the accused had come to Gujarat to kill a political leader. The court accepted the prosecution’s argument and sentenced Shaikh to five years in prison.

A theft occurred at a bungalow in Ranchada, Ahmedabad, on Wednesday night, where the thieves stole ₹20,000 from the house of Harish Guttikar.. The theft took place when Harish (61) and his mother (96) were sleeping at their residence in Rancharda, when four thieves, two of them carrying weapons, broke into the house. Harish, woken up by the noise, found the thieves in the house, taking away valuables from his wife’s purse and his laptop. When Harish made the noise, the thieves ran away, however, not before making a futile attempt at stealing Harish’s car. The police arrived at the scene, and Harish was told to visit the Santej police station at 8 in the morning to file a complaint. Next day, not only Harish was made to wait till 4 pm in the afternoon, he was later told that only an application will be enough since the amount of theft was ‘only ₹20,000’. As one of Harish’s friend was acquainted with Rajkot Inspector General (IG) Ashok Yadav, the latter called Gandhinagar Superintendent of Police (SP) Ravi Teja and informed him about Harish’s situation. SP Teja later asked Police Sub Inspector (PSI) Chudasama of Santej police station to file a complaint immediately and begin investigation. For Harish, in his own words, the amount of theft was a secondary issue, but the reason to complaint was his mother’s safety, which was compromised as the thieves were carrying weapons.

Asia’s final giant IMAX moves towards digital future,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/entertainment/asias-final-giant-imax-moves-towards-digital-future,2024-11-30,30,11,2024,"Science City’s IMAX If things go as planned, the world’s most powerful technologies for big-screen cinema projection – the IMAX giant theatre – at Science City in Ahmedabad will see a transformation. More than 20 years after it was started with much fanfare, financial complications and technical constraints have led the authorities to consider a switch to digital IMAX technology. Operated by the Gujarat Council of Science City under the Government of Gujarat, Science City’s IMAX has been limited to screening only science-fiction films for the past three to four years. Moreover, as Asia’s last surviving 3D giant theatre, it requires substantial financial and technical investments. Officials in the know reveal that the council aims to switch to a digital equivalent within a year. ‘Show must go on’ Currently, the IMAX theatre hosts not more than two shows a day, running on a rare technology patented by the IMAX company in Canada. Explaining the move towards digital, Jitendra B Vadar, executive director of Gujarat Council of Science City (he was recently transferred to another department), said: “The IMAX company currently undertakes the maintenance of this technology under a contract. Once that contract runs out, maintenance would be a tremendously complicated task.” The department has a $90,000 (₹75,86,000) per year maintenance contract with IMAX, which covers quarterly upkeep. “They also send us necessary spare parts, making us totally dependent on them,” Vadar elaborates. Another reason for going digital, he adds, is that, “production companies have almost stopped producing films in reel format, creating a major shortage of titles for our shows.” Science City’s IMAX has screened films like Titanic and Avatar in 3D in the past. Vadar attributes the current limitations to IMAX, which no longer provides reels for popular films. He explains: “We communicated our desire in screening Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar, and the second part of Avatar. We were willing to purchase the reel if available, but IMAX even charges a fee to check availability, limiting our options.” The council intends to continue this partnership, and hopes to secure better movie options for around a year before they shift towards digital. ‘Real IMAX’ goes down as an exhibit Considered a spectacle, the IMAX theatre will lose its ‘real IMAX’ status after digital conversion. Reel-based technology offers 18K resolution, regarded as the true IMAX format for 3D. Globally, only Melbourne, Australia, currently achieves these specifications. As the council transitions to digital, Vadar said that they are “considering setting up an exhibit on the premises to showcase this iconic technology as an attraction”. He added, “Cinema enthusiasts will be able to experience the reel-based IMAX through this exhibit, which could keep its legacy alive.” When asked about the exhibit’s feasibility, Vadar remarked, “Although the technology is patented, the machine is eventually our property.” IMAX Specs The IMAX uses the super rare 15x70mm film reel for 3D projection. Science City’s IMAX can seat 647 people, and boasts the largest IMAX projection screen in Asia, measuring 67 feet long and 97 feet wide. Bhavik Trivedi, who manages the IMAX projector room, explains that every show is projected using two Xenon lamps of 15,000 watts each.",ahmedabad

When the police arrive at the scene, the city police claim it falls under their jurisdiction, while the rural police insist it belongs to them. As a result, victims and complainants are often left confused and frustrated, sometimes for hours. Meanwhile, crime continues to rise, but the police are still engaged in jurisdictional debates. To resolve this issue permanently, there are discussions to permanently include the SP Ring Road area under Ahmedabad rural police jurisdiction. The Gujarat Home department is considering gathering details from both rural and city police departments and may soon make an important decision on the jurisdictional matter. When incidents occur near Sardar Patel Ring Road, which falls under the jurisdiction of police stations like Sarkhej or Bopal in Ahmedabad City, it often creates confusion about which police station is responsible for the area. This results in delays in determining the jurisdiction, causing significant inconvenience to the victims and complainants, and in some cases, giving accused individuals the opportunity to escape. Similar jurisdictional issues have arisen with the Aslali, Kanbha, and Changodar police stations, as well as with Gandhinagar police. Recently, police officers presented this issue to Ahmedabad Commissioner of Police G S Malik, suggesting that including the SP Ring Road area under Ahmedabad rural police could solve this ongoing jurisdictional dispute. The Ahmedabad City Police is preparing a presentation to submit to the Home department, which will include details of previous cases and conflicts related to jurisdiction.

Witnesses reported that the Creta struck stones placed on the road divider, launching it into the air before it crashed into the Activa coming from the opposite direction. The collision’s impact was so severe that neither victim had a chance of survival. Eyewitnesses stated that Patel, visibly intoxicated, was seen eating sweets after the crash. Furious locals apprehended him, pulling him from the car and handing him over to the police following a heated exchange. Police Action and Investigation Kanbha police arrived at the scene shortly after the incident and arrested Patel. Ahmedabad Rural SP Om Prakash Jat confirmed that Patel was heavily intoxicated and lost control of his vehicle while attempting to overtake a rickshaw. A case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder has been filed against him, and further investigations are underway. SP Jat also noted concerns about the stones placed on the road divider, which caused the car to go airborne. “While the driver’s intoxication and recklessness are undeniable, the presence of such stones on the divider is equally troubling. We will report this to the concerned authorities to prevent similar tragedies, Apart from that we have initiated the paper work for the suspension of his driving licence.” he added. The police have also registered a complaint over the thrashing the driver after the incident. A Worrying Pattern of Drunk Driving This incident highlights an alarming rise in drunk driving cases in Ahmedabad. It is the second major case within eight days. Last week, a driver named Ripal Panchal caused significant damage to multiple vehicles on the Bhopal-Ambli Road, though fortunately, no casualties were reported. He was release on bail on the next day itself, while police have recommended to suspend his driving licence. Apart from that the FSL and medical reports are yet to be received by M division of police for further investigation of the matter. In another recent incident on SG Highway, a speeding car struck two doctors cycling, leaving them critically injured. The accused, Pranav Vora, reportedly attended a liquor party with friends in Vastrapur before driving under the influence. Following the accident, he fled to Udaipur, attempting to evade the authorities. The police launched an extensive probe to track him down.",ahmedabad

Ahmedabad airport’s user development fee increased nine-fold in five years,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-airports-user-development-fee-increased-nine-fold-in-five-years,2024-12-03,3,12,2024,"Since Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport (SVPI) was handed over to the Adani Group, there has been a staggering increase of over 900% in the User Development Fee (UDF) in the past five years. The UDF is collected from passengers along with their tickets to bridge any revenue shortfall. In 2020, UDF for domestic passengers was ₹85, which is now ₹450. Similarly, the UDF for international passengers was ₹85 in 2020. This has been hiked to ₹880. Despite this sharp increase, passengers have been complaining of long queues, lack of amenities, and inadequate services. The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA) is responsible for overseeing if operators managing airports use the fees collected appropriately to enhance facilities. AERA is also tasked with ensuring that any fee hikes are justified by improved services. However, critics claim there has been no justification for the fee hikes implemented at Ahmedabad airport, raising concerns about the adherence to regulations. Over the past three years, the Adani Group has significantly increased fees. However, the allegations are that instead of improving passenger services, the funds are used for works outside the terminal building. In 2020, the UDF for domestic passengers was ₹85. On March 1, 2022, it was increased to ₹250, almost doubling the fee with a hike of ₹165. For international passengers, the UDF rose from ₹85 in 2020 to ₹635 by March 3, 2023, an increase of ₹550. For the 2024-25 fiscal year, the UDF has been fixed at ₹450 for domestic passengers and ₹880 for international passengers, sparking further discontent among travellers.

Acting on a tip-off, the police saved a man’s life and arrested the accused, who posed as a tantric and exploited superstitious beliefs for financial gain. As per the case, Jigar Bhanubhai Gohil, a resident of Krishna Kunj Society in Ahmedabad, approached Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone-7) Shivam Varma with a harrowing account. According to Gohil, a man named Abhi Rajput was lured into a trap by Nawalsinh Arvindsinh Chavda, a self-proclaimed tantric. Chavda had promised Abhi miraculous financial gains, claiming he could turn one rupee into four using occult practices. On December 1, 2024, Abhi was summoned to Sanathal, where he was allegedly served a drink laced with a poisonous substance. Chawda’s sinister plan involved causing Abhi’s death through a heart attack or an accident, after which he would steal the victim’s money. When Gohil informed the police about the potential danger, Sarkhej Police Inspector R K Dhulia and his team sprang into action. Through human intelligence and efficient teamwork, the officers tracked down both the victim and the accused within hours. Abhi Rajput was rescued unharmed, and the accused was apprehended before he could execute his sinister plan. Mastermind unmasked The accused, Nawalsinh Chavda, hails from Vejalpur in Ahmedabad and has a history of exploiting gullible individuals by claiming to possess supernatural powers.

Further investigation into the matter is ongoing, and we are also looking into whether there were other victims of his crimes,” said a senior police officer.",ahmedabad

As per a complaint filed on Monday, 64-year-old Krishnamohan Chakrapani, a resident of Ambawadi’s Bhudarpura Road vicinity, was given online tasks by a bogus firm. Chakrapani was asked to conduct these tasks on Instagram, as well as a few related to cryptocurrency. It all began when Chakrapani received a text on his WhatsApp from an unknown person named ‘Ananya’ on November 19, 2023, offering him a work-from-home opportunity. As he sent an affirmation text for this offer, Chakrapani was redirected to Telegram. He was added to a channel with the handle @Kapoor252545. Thereafter, a person named Alisha Kapoor handed him Instagram tasks to complete. He was tasked to join Instagram, where he was added by a user named Aditya Gupta with the ID ‘foodie_aditya’. Similarly, he was allocated tasks involving other users. He was then asked to send screenshots of his completed tasks, for which he received ₹90 each. The money he made through these tasks was also reflected in his profile. He was also asked to share his account details by the perpetrators. Alisha redirected him to conduct further tasks and connected him to another person named Rahul Agrawal through Telegram. Agrawal handed Chakrapani a few cryptocurrency tasks and asked him to log into a specific link. While conducting those tasks, his account was frozen abruptly. Claiming that your profits would be lost, Rahul asked for a hefty amount from Chakrapani to unfreeze the account. He was then connected with an individual named Arpit Singhal, who claimed to be the CEO and director of the firm. He asked for a security amount of ₹76 lakh to safeguard the deposits and profits he had earned, which he promised would eventually be returned to him. He was asked by a person claiming to be the ‘senior controller’ of this firm to deposit the amount in different accounts. Following this, Chakrapani made transactions amounting to a total of ₹93.86 lakh in 19 different bank accounts. Upon neither being returned his deposited amount nor the promised profits, Chakrapani lodged a complaint before the Cyber Crime Police Station.

Swift action by office employees helped contain the blaze before it could escalate into a disaster. No casualties were reported, and the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) arrived promptly to ensure the situation was under control. The fire, which reportedly originated on the 10th-floor balcony, spread partially to the 9th and 11th floors before being brought under control. While the exact cause remains under investigation, officials suspect it might have been triggered by a discarded cigarette butt or an electrical short circuit. Employees’ heroic response The fire was first noticed by staff working in a software company located on the 10th floor. Employees were immediately evacuated from the premises. However, three employees — Jayantibhai Vaghela (office assistant), Ashutosh Rathore (SEO Operator), and Jaimin Rane — stayed behind to combat the fire. Using a fire extinguisher, the trio initially attempted to contain the flames. When the extinguisher proved inadequate, Vaghela turned to a water hose, with Rathore and Rane assisting him. Over the next 25 minutes, their combined efforts managed to subdue the fire, preventing it from spreading further. Jayantibhai Vaghela said, “I was inside the office when one of the employees alerted us. As soon as I found out, I grabbed a fire extinguisher and started helping others. However, as the fire began to spread and I started feeling the intense heat, something in my mind told me to use the water hose instead. I acted on that instinct, and fortunately, it worked.” Fire brigade’s prompt arrival The AFES was alerted promptly and dispatched two fire brigades, which arrived at the scene within 15 minutes. By the time firefighters reached the site, the employees had already contained the flames. Fire personnel inspected the premises to ensure no residual sparks or hazards remained.

Meanwhile, building authorities have been advised to review and reinforce their fire safety measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

This initiative, launched in collaboration with SmartCity, aims to curb traffic violations and enable real-time monitoring of the city’s increasing vehicular activity. As part of the initiative, over 60 devices have been handed over to the Ahmedabad Traffic Police. Of these, 29 dashcams will be installed in traffic vehicles, including interceptors, while 31 portable devices will be issued to traffic personnel for use at critical locations as required. This technology will allow automatic detecting and recording of violations such as riding without helmets, triple riding, wrong-side driving, and dangerous driving, providing concrete evidence for legal action. Automated monitoring and enforcement “The traffic personnel only need to activate the mobile devices, which will begin recording videos. Within 30 to 40 seconds, the software will automatically recognize traffic offenders and capture photos and videos. These are then sent to the control room server, where a team verifies the evidence. Challans are subsequently generated and violators are notified via SMS,” explained Safin Hasan, Traffic DCP. Addressing a growing concern Ahmedabad has witnessed a sharp increase in vehicular traffic, contributing to a rise in road accidents. Fatal incidents involving motorcyclists without helmets remain particularly high. Despite ongoing awareness campaigns, violations persist, making stricter enforcement measures essential. A senior traffic official highlighted the benefits of the new system, stating, “The dashcams ensure accurate documentation of violations, protect officers from false accusations, and provide an unbiased account of on-ground situations.” Pilot project success A pilot phase was conducted two months ago at the SG-1 and SG-2 traffic police stations, where five devices were installed in vehicles. The results were promising, with 794 helmet-related violations, 21 instances of dangerous driving, and 14 seatbelt-related offenses recorded. Legal action was promptly initiated against the violators. The dashcams’ AI technology integrates seamlessly with existing traffic systems. Violations are automatically recorded and uploaded to Nayan’s cloud server, verified at the control room, and transferred to the National Informatics Centre (NIC) server. Offenders are notified through the “One Nation, One Challan” system. Plans for expansion The Ahmedabad Traffic Police intend to expand the scope of monitored violations to include offences such as illegal parking and other infractions. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, the department aims to reduce road accidents, streamline traffic, and ensure stricter adherence to regulations. Plans are also underway to introduce more devices to enhance traffic management further.",ahmedabad

Khyati hospital director Sanjay Patoliya surrenders to Crime Branch,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/khyati-hospital-director-sanjay-patoliya-surrenders-to-crime-branch,2024-12-05,5,12,2024,"One of the directors of Khyati hospital who had been absconding in connection with the deaths of two patients following fraudulent surgeries under the PM-JAY scheme, has finally surrendered to the Crime Branch. Sanjay Patoliya whose anticipatory bail plea had been rejected by a local court, surrendered against the Crime Branch on Wednesday. During interrogation, it was revealed that upon sensing the impending legal trouble after the deaths of two patients, Dr Patoliya fled to Rajkot on the night of November 13, even before the case was officially filed. He turned off his phone and hid in his car at a hospital compound in Rajkot before travelling to various cities, including Udaipur, Nathdwara, Ajmer, Pali, Jaipur, and Delhi, staying in small hotels and using different travel modes to avoid detection. Crime Branch Assistant Commissioner of Police Bharat Patel said, “Patoliya was a stakeholder in 39% activities as a director at Khyati Multispeciality Hospital.” “He played a significant role in patient care decisions, initiating new departments, and hiring doctors. He also had access to all records related to surgeries and treatments conducted under the PM-JAY scheme,” he added. So far, the Crime Branch has arrested seven individuals, including Chirag Rajput, Rahul Jain, Milind Patel, Dr Prashant Vazirani, and two marketing team members. The Crime Branch suspects the scam involves certain officials and employees linked to the PM-JAY scheme. They have requested detailed records of surgeries and financial transactions under the scheme. However, the health department has yet to provide complete information, despite repeated requests and summons issued to four to five officials. Arrests of some health department officials are likely in the coming days. Also read: Ahmedabad court rejects anticipatory bail of Khyati hospital director",ahmedabad

Priyanshu Kushwaha (23) who was studying at the library with other students received 10 stitches after a ceiling fan fell on him at 5 pm. The library authorities were unconcerned when being told about the incident, saying, “You shouldn’t sit under the fan.” Following the incident, an uproar occurred outside the library with students alleging a lack of basic facilities. “The library has been managed by the AMC since 2018. However, since then, the authorities have paid no attention to its maintenance. Issues like drinking water, seating arrangement, and cleanliness remain unresolved. Even after this accident, no officials visited the site,” wrote activist Yuvrajsinh Jadeja on X.

"Ahmedabad is booming! Shopping festival sales cross ₹69,000 cr! Growth 20%, but sorry data is not available",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-shopping-festival-sales-cross-69-000-cr-but-data-not-available,2024-12-06,6,12,2024,"The Gujarat Information Department released a statement about the grand success of the Ahmedabad Shopping Festival (ASF) on Thursday afternoon. The first press note released around 3 pm mentioned ₹69 crore+ sales and a record over 20% revenue growth. Two hours later, another press note was released. This time, the sales figures jumped to an eye-popping ₹69,000 crore! A scale-up of 10,000 times! The release goes on to boast a record 20% revenue growth, but no comparative figures of earlier sales have been released, raising questions about how they arrived at the record growth figure. The release states that the first phase saw 20 lakh visitors to the festival. If we go by the sales figure of ₹69,000 crore in October 2024, it roughly translates to every visitor having spent ₹3,45,000. As per the release, PM Modi inaugurated the ASF in 2019 to celebrate the city’s rich heritage, empower businesses and artisans, and boost the tourism sector. Building on this vision, CM Bhupendra Patel launched the grand ‘Ahmedabad Shopping Festival’ on Dussehra, on October 12, 2024. So, five shopping festivals have been organised in the city till now, then what begs the question is why has the state government not released any year-wise sales figures when business is booming. The shopping festival is organised in collaboration with the Amdavad Municipal Corporation and the Government of Gujarat. So, we called up Deputy Municipal Commissioner Mirant Pareek to understand how the figure of ₹69,000 crore was arrived at. Pareek told Gujarat Samachar Digital, “The calculation of this ₹69,000 crore has been based on the difference between the GST revenue of October 2023 and the revenue of October 2024.” However, when probed further, he hung up. The press release goes on to mention 20 lakh visitors to the festival in the first phase from October 12 to November 1. This means, roughly 1 lakh people visited the four major shopping districts – Sindhu Bhavan Road, C G Road, Nikol Modern Street, and Kankaria Rambag Road – and 14 prominent hotspots daily in the city. ASF began on October 12 and will last until Uttarayan, a total of 95 days. The festival is divided into three phases: from October 12 to November 1, November 11 to December 13, and December 15 to January 15, 2025. Exciting initiatives such as maximum discounts, lucky draws, coupons, and attractive prizes boosted the revenue of participating stores, the statement claims. In illuminated areas such as CG Road, sales across 30-40 stores saw an increase of 12-15%. It concludes by stating that overall, the ASF achieved an impressive ₹69,904 crore in sales during October 2024, marking a 20.5% growth compared to October 2023.

Lack of CCTV footage hampers investigation into constable’s death on Riverfront Road,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/lack-of-cctv-footage-hampers-investigation-into-constables-death-on-riverfront-road,2024-12-06,6,12,2024,"The tragic death of 28-year-old constable Shardaben Dabhi in a hit-and-run accident on Ahmedabad’s busy Riverfront Road on Thursday has raised questions about the city’s surveillance infrastructure. The absence of CCTV cameras on this high-traffic stretch has left police struggling to identify the vehicle involved in the fatal incident. Riverfront Road, an 11-kilometre stretch known for heavy vehicular movement, remains largely uncovered by surveillance systems despite claims by authorities that Ahmedabad is under robust CCTV monitoring. Out of the 16 junctions along the Riverfront, only three or four are equipped with functional cameras connected to the city’s central control room. The rest remain vulnerable, leaving significant gaps in monitoring. Police officials are finding it challenging to piece together evidence in Dabhi’s case. “We submitted a proposal to the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Limited (SRFDCL) over a year ago, requesting coverage of all junctions. However, after installing cameras at a few locations, the work was inexplicably halted,” a senior police officer said, “We are missing out on a major chunk of the city without surveillance, which is critical for preventing and investigating crimes.” Currently, Ahmedabad boasts around 2,000 CCTV cameras at 130 junctions under the Smart City Project. However, the Riverfront, a key artery of the city, has been overlooked. Explaining the delays, Dev Chaudhary, Deputy Municipal Commissioner of SRFDCL, said, “We are not planning to install additional cameras at the moment. Setting up a parallel system with its own control room would require significant resources. The existing Smart City infrastructure should ideally be extended to include the Riverfront.” The hit-and-run case has once again highlights gaps in Ahmedabad’s ambitious Smart City initiative, with citizens and officials calling for immediate action. For a city aspiring to leverage technology for safety and efficiency, the lack of surveillance on a critical stretch like the Riverfront underscores the urgent need for better planning and execution. In the meantime, police continue their efforts to solve the case, relying on witness accounts and other evidence. However, without crucial video footage, their task remains daunting. The tragic loss of Shardaben Dabhi serves as a grim reminder of the need for a comprehensive surveillance network in all parts of the city.",ahmedabad

112 patients of Khyati hospital lost lives in three years,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/112-patients-of-khyati-hospital-lost-lives-in-three-years,2024-12-06,6,12,2024,"Ahmedabad Crime Branch revealed that the Khyati Multispeciality Hospital performed a total of 3,842 surgeries under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) in the past three years. Importantly, a total of 112 patients died during or after these treatments. Investigations revealed that proper care was not taken during treatment, leading to suspicions of negligence by the hospital in these deaths. In light of these findings, a joint investigation by the Crime Branch and a medical expert committee will be conducted to probe the suspicious deaths. Initial investigations show that patients from rural areas were subjected to unnecessary angiographies and stent placements. Five separate complaints have been filed at Vastrapur Police Station regarding suspicious deaths after stent placements in this hospital. Additional cases from Central and North Gujarat have also come to light, bringing the total number of reported deaths to 11. So far, the Crime Branch has arrested Dr Sanjay Patoliya, Chirag Rajput, Rahul Jain, Milind Patel, Dr Prashant Vazirani, and two marketing team members. ACP Bharat Patel of the Ahmedabad Crime Branch shared that between September 1, 2021, and October 28, 2024, a total of 8,534 patients received treatment at Khyati hospital. Of these, 3,842 were treated under PM-JAY, with 112 deaths reported either during or after surgeries. This significant figure has prompted detailed investigations into all deceased patients’ reports and treatments. Staff members at Khyati hospital testified that operations were conducted recklessly under PM-JAY 'solely for financial gain'. As a result, the 112 deaths are suspected to have been caused by negligence, and senior officials have instructed a thorough investigation. During a remand hearing for Dr Patoliya, the medical director of the hospital, the Crime Branch revealed to the court that the accused fabricated an audit report showing a loss of ₹1.5 crore as part of their conspiracy. The court granted the Crime Branch seven days of remand for the accused to seize vital documents, including the fabricated audit report. Despite the handover of this serious case to the Crime Branch by Ahmedabad Commissioner of Police G S Malik, delays in apprehending the accused have drawn criticism.

Following a request from the police department, the RTO revoked both his two-wheeler and four-wheeler licenses permanently.

The onlookers beat him for his actions before handing him over to the M Division traffic police. The rampage began when the Audi first collided with a Harrier SUV near the ISKCON Bridge. The driver continued recklessly, hitting a three-wheeler and another car before crashing into a Nexon near a Tata Motors dealership.

"Fake medical degree scam uncovered in Surat, Ahmedabad,  over 1,200 bogus degrees sold",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/fake-medical-degree-uncovered-in-surat-ahmedabad-over-1-200-bogus-degrees-sold,2024-12-06,6,12,2024,"In a major fake degree scam involving bogus medical degrees being sold in Surat and Ahmedabad, police have arrested several individuals and seized evidence from various locations. The scam was led by Dr Rasesh Gujarati from Gopipura and Dr B K Rawat from Ahmedabad. Following the discovery of the scam, raids were conducted at their homes, where police discovered a list of 1,630 fake doctors allegedly registered on Dr Rawat’s website. The Pandesara police received a tip-off that two persons named Devanath and Kailash from Kailash Chowk had started clinics in the area and were practicing medicine without any medical degree. Acting on this information, police raided the clinic in Pandora and seized a large stock of medications from the clinic, and also raided Shreyank Clinic in Ishwar Nagar, recovering medicines worth ₹55,210. During questioning, the accused revealed that they had procured fake degrees from Dr Rasesh Gujarati. Gujarati and Rawat had set up two schemes to sell fake degrees. In the first scheme, they charged ₹70,000 for a fake BEMS degree, allowing the buyer to run a clinic and practice medicine. The buyer had to pay ₹1,500 annually for registration and an additional ₹1,500 for an association fee. In the second scheme, they sold degrees for ₹70,000, but also required a monthly “protection money” fee. One of the individuals who purchased a fake degree, Vijay Yadav, was forced to pay the registration and protection fees to run a clinic. When he refused, Gujarati allegedly threatened to kill him. During the investigation, it was found that some individuals who received fake degrees from these doctors were also involved in cases where patients died due to improper treatment. Gujarati had sold over 1,000 fake degrees, and evidence from Rawat’s office revealed the collection of ₹1,500 for registration fees from several doctors. If anyone refused to renew their registration or pay the protection money, they were threatened with notices. Gujarati paid ₹5,000 to those who brought in new customers, and Rawat received a commission of 30% of the total fee. Raids were also carried out at health complexes and other properties associated with the suspects, where police found several documents, including registration forms, doctors’ records, application forms for BEMS degrees, notices issued by Dr Rawat, high court orders, identity cards, and other certificates. This scam, involving fake medical degrees, has jeopardised public health by allowing unqualified individuals to practice medicine, putting patients’ lives at risk.

Ahmedabad Crime Branch exposes ₹1.5 crore fraud and fake audit report in Khyati hospital scam,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-crime-branch-exposes-1-5-crore-fraud-and-fake-audit-report-in-khyati-hospital,2024-12-06,6,12,2024,"Dr. Sanjay Patoliya New revelations are coming to light in the Khyati hospital scam, where innocent patients were misdiagnosed and treated accordingly to siphon off millions of rupees through government schemes. An audit report indicating a loss of ₹1.5 crore was fabricated as part of the scam. During a hearing for the remand application of Dr Sanjay Patoliya, the hospital’s medical director, the Ahmedabad Crime Branch revealed that the audit report showing a loss of ₹1.5 crore was created as a part of the scam. The report was fabricated with the intention of misdirecting the investigation. Along with the audit report, other critical documents have been seized for further examination. Patoliya was presented in court for remand. The crime branch had requested his  14-day remand, stating that Patoliya, who has been with the hospital since 2021 and holds a 39% stake, was likely the key figure behind the financial benefits gained through the scam. It is suspected that he planned and executed the financial gains, both directly and indirectly, from the scam. Additionally, the investigation aims to probe the kind of medical treatment and expertise that should have been provided for cardiac and other treatments, and whether the accused was aware of the medical standards and deliberately manipulated them. As a director, Patoliya was fully aware of the hospital’s financial dealings and how government scheme benefits were exploited for personal gains. Investigators also seek to examine his bank account details to understand the financial transactions and connections to other potential scams. The crime branch believes that a custodial interrogation of Patoliya is crucial to uncover links to other fraudulent activities. Taking into account these points and the reasons for the remand, the court granted a seven-day remand for Dr Sanjay Patoliya.

How’s the buzz at the International Book Festival in Ahmedabad?,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/hows-the-buzz-at-the-international-book-festival-in-ahmedabad,2024-12-06,6,12,2024,"image: National Book Trust, India As the city witnesses a nip in the air, book lovers make their way to the first edition of the Ahmedabad International Book Festival (AIBF) at Sabarmati Riverfront Event Centre. The 9-day event featuring 340 book stalls set up by 147 exhibitors from 13 Indian states is organised by the National Book Trust (NBT), India, under the Union Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC). Gujarat Samachar Digital team was on the ground at the AIBF to find out what people thought about the festival. Ardent book lover and student at CEPT University, Honey, says, “The fair is nice and you’ll have to walk to later sections for novels and fictional books.” However, she thinks that the AIBF has a good collection, but “they haven’t advertised much”. Kalpita, another CEPT student accompanying Honey, is more forthright when she says, “The sections look ‘chaotic at first’ but you’ll find your book after searching.” A teacher at DPS, Neetu Bhardwaj, says, “They should have kept more time for the fair. On the weekdays, after work hours, one who has to visit the bookfair from 9-10 km away has no time to cherish it as it closes around 9 pm.” “I suggest that the organisers should extend the days of the bookfair, as one needs time to explore the vast collection,” Bhardwaj added. Some book revellers also emphasised that such a grand event should have a free drinking water facility and a place to sit while looking at some books. “Till now, the response of Amdavadis is quite amazing as many people have turned up even on weekdays,” said Amit Kumar Singh, public relations head, NBT-India. “On the weekend, almost 1.5 lakh people visited AIBF. On weekdays also, we see crowds after 3 pm,” Singh added. About Ahmedabad’s reading culture, Singh said, “Amdavadis are curious, they know which books they want and find them""",ahmedabad

Toll tax troubles spike as state govt choses to charge extra premium,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/toll-tax-troubles-spike-as-state-govt-choses-to-charge-extra-premium,2024-12-07,7,12,2024,"In the name of the ‘development’ of roads, the state government is reportedly charging a 10% premium along with toll tax. According to reports, toll tax on Ahmedabad-Viramgam-Maliya and Halol-Godhra-Shamlaji roads is increasing significantly. The concession agreement made for the expansion of the Shamlaji road now includes a 10% premium to be charged for every vehicle. As the toll prices spike, transportation costs incurred in a business have increased, further increasing the price of a particular product. The transport agencies have recently written a letter to Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel regarding the extra premium charged on toll tax. The premium has been increasing by 1% every year as the roads turn six-lane from four-lane. In addition to 10% of the total toll revenue collected in the previous year, a 1% annual increase is being charged. Based on the income generated in the previous year, a premium of 10.21% in the first year and a premium of 11.21% is being charged for the second and the third year. Despite the state government’s zero investments in the road, a total of 15% share of income goes to the state. Notably, in Gujarat, there are approximately 17 or more such roads on which the state government is collecting a premium on toll. The premium is determined based on the number of passenger vehicles passing through the road. If a car, taxi, or pickup van passes through it, it is counted as one vehicle.

The seizure pertains to a case lodged on November 7 against the Nashik Merchant Cooperative (NAMCO) Bank, in Malegaon town of the Nashik district. Following a complaint, the Malegaon Chavani Police Station had lodged an FIR last month on mystery deposits of huge money of more than ₹100 crore in 14 newly-opened bank accounts at the NAMCO Bank. The police FIR named the prime suspect as Siraj A M Harun Memon, who operates a hot and cold beverages agency, plus his accomplices who used ‘identity documents of various innocent persons (obtained by false promises / monetary considerations) to layer and transfer the proceeds of the crime’. Later, the case, was probed by the ED as the suspicious transactions in multiple states came just weeks before the November 20 Maharashtra Assembly elections. The ED probe found that at least five similar accounts were maintained with the Bank of Maharashtra, Nashik Branch. The ED investigated the money trail of ‘debit transactions’ made through various online banking channels from the 14 accounts at NAMCO Bank and the five accounts with BoM. The startling outcome was that the funds from these accounts were transferred to 21 sole proprietary concerns through debit transactions, which also came under the ED's radar. A detailed analysis of the bank statements of the 21 sole proprietory concerns where the hundreds of crores of rupees of funds were transferred through online banking channels, and these in turn were further routed to various other firms/companies said to be fake accounts. Subsequently, the analysis revealed that a huge amount of money was withdrawn in cash from these dummy accounts, including by Nagani Akram M Shafi, and Vasim V Bhesaniya. The duo then distributed the cash to various entities through ‘angadiyas’ (traditional personal couriers) or ‘hawala’ operators in Ahmedabad, Surat, and Mumbai. The ED contended that the Bhesania-Shafi duo - later arrested for money-laundering charges - worked under instructions of one Mehmood Bhagad alias Challenger King. Last month, the ED carried out around 25 searches in Ahmedabad, Surat, Nashik and Mumbai and laid its hands on bank balances of ₹5.20 crore, plus incriminating documents, digital evidence, bank deposits and other deals, etc. (This story was taken from a syndicated feed and was only edited for style by Gujarat Samachar Digital team)",ahmedabad

In conversation with Gujarat Samachar Digital , a few of them shared about their time with the Swaminarayan temple complexes across the globe. Shashi Brahmbhatt, who serves at the San Jose Swaminarayan temple in California, US, is involved in the temple’s children-based activities. He described the experience of attending the event as mesmerising. Sharing his experience, Brahmbhatt said, “When I reached the stadium, there were signboards everywhere, the workers greeted us with folded hands, they were standing in the sun, they spoke lovingly, they showed us the way, so it didn’t feel like we had come from abroad, it felt like these workers had known us for years. We saw incredible love for us. Who wouldn't love to come to a place with such acceptance?” Darshan Bhatt, who has been living in Dubai, UAE, for the past 32 years and serves at the Swaminarayan temple in Abu Dhabi, also attended the Suvarna Mahotsav. Sharing insights from the Abu Dhabi temple, he said, “People from all states of India come in large numbers to our Swaminarayan temple, the only Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi. So we have begun doing ‘ katha ’ in Hindi as well for them to  understand. And we have also started sessions in Marathi and English to erase any language barriers for the devotees.” Chandrakant Brahmbhatt has been living in the US for the past 30 years, but is originally from Gujarat’s Khambhat. He currently serves at the Swaminarayan temple in Robbinsville, New Jersey. Speaking about the devotees, Brahmbhatt said, “Devotees appreciate each other’s work, which gives us a booster dose. We intend to contribute better in our field of work for our faith, and our enthusiasm also increases. This appreciation acts like a booster dose. The purpose of the ‘Karyakar Survarna Mahotsav’ was also the same. This programme has given a booster dose for the next ten years to lakhs of workers like us.” Roshni Brahmbhatt, an Indian-origin born in the US, currently resides in San Jose, and serves at the Swaminarayan temple. Roshni shared an anecdote from her upbringing, which could be an insight for those willing to settle abroad. Speaking about how she got involved with BAPS, Roshni said, “When I was young, my father heard Pramukh Swami Maharaj’s speeches, and he said that everyone comes to the US to accumulate progeny and wealth, but if we don’t build the foundation of culture and institution, then we will get neither. My father used to take me to the ‘Balika Sabha’ when I was young where the workers of the sabha taught me Gujarati, what it means to be a Hindu, and what are the values of the satsang, among other lessons.” Also read: BAPS Karyakar Suvarna Mahotsav at Narendra Modi Stadium a spectacle to behold",ahmedabad
Tantric dies in police custody in Ahmedabad after 'confession' of 12 murders,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/tantrik-dies-in-police-custody-ahmedabad-confession-12-murders,2024-12-08,8,12,2024,"Ahmedabad tantrik murders A self-proclaimed tantric, Nawalsinh Chavda, who was in police custody for allegedly committing 12 murders over 13 years, passed away on Sunday under mysterious circumstances during police remand. The case has triggered outrage and calls for a judicial investigation. Chavda, who was arrested by Sarkhej police, had reportedly confessed to murdering 12 individuals, including his mother, grandmother, and uncle. The victims were poisoned with sodium nitrite, a chemical commonly used in painting and finishing work. Chavda would allegedly mix the substance into water or liquor, causing fatal heart attacks within minutes. As per the police, Chavda during questioning revealed that he had acquired sodium nitrate from a laboratory in Surendranagar and carried out occult rituals at a shrine in Surendranagar. Police also found that Chavda had three children and led a double life as a family man and a feared tantrik. Sudden death in lockup On the morning of December 8, Chavda reportedly fell ill in police custody. He vomitted and collapsed, prompting officers to rush him to the hospital. Despite receiving immediate medical attention, Chavda was pronounced dead. Police have initiated postmortem procedures to determine the cause of death. Given the custodial nature of the death, a judicial inquiry has been ordered. Shivam Varma, DCP of Zone 7, stated, “We are conducting a transparent investigation into the circumstances of his death. The postmortem report will guide further action.” Prior to his death, Chavda had been taken to his shrine in Wadhwan for evidence collection. Statements were also recorded from shopkeepers who sold him sodium nitrate. The police were probing the possibility of additional accomplices in the murders. Chavda’s confessions revealed a horrifying pattern of manipulation and murder under the guise of occult rituals. Sodium nitrate poisoning would initially mimic a natural death, complicating police investigations. Details about the case On December 2, the Sarkhej police team, with the assistance of the Local Crime Branch (LCB) of Zone-7, prevented what could have been a chilling case of human sacrifice and fraud. Acting on a tip-off, the police saved a man’s life and arrested the accused, who posed as a tantric and exploited superstitious beliefs for financial gain. As per the case, Jigar Bhanubhai Gohil, a resident of Krishna Kunj Society in Ahmedabad, approached Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone-7) Shivam Varma claiming a man named Abhi Rajput was lured into a trap by Nawalsinh Chavda, a self-proclaimed tantric. Chavda had promised Abhi miraculous financial gains, claiming he could turn one rupee into four using occult practices. On December 1, 2024, Abhi was summoned to Sanathal, where he was supposed to be served a drink laced with a poisonous substance. Chavda’s sinister plan involved causing Abhi’s death through a heart attack or an accident, after which he would steal the victim’s money. When Gohil informed the police about the potential danger, Sarkhej Police Inspector R K Dhulia and his team sprang into action. Through human intelligence and efficient teamwork, the officers tracked down both the victim and the accused within hours. Abhi Rajput was rescued unharmed, and the accused was apprehended before he could execute his sinister plan. Also read: Gujarat passes landmark Bill to curb human sacrifice and black magic",ahmedabad

These include the minutes books of the hospital’s directors, patient data, and treatment details for both regular and corporate patients. The search was conducted between 4.30 pm and 6.30 pm, in the presence of chartered accountants, IT experts, and videographers. The team focused on Dr Patolia’s office and operation theatre. Searches were also carried out in the offices of other directors and the CEO. The server room of the hospital, containing administrative and patient-related data, as well as accounts, was examined. The investigation team, with the help of employees working on the hospital’s IT and accounting systems, accessed the server and seized electronic data. Data of 141 patients treated under various schemes, including ONGC, Western Railway, Steel Authority, Ex-Servicemen Health Scheme, and PRL, were also collected.

The complainant, Surekha Desai, stated that she was subjected to threats of being set ablaze and killed, along with repeated instances of assault and verbal abuse. The complaint was lodged at Vastrapur Police Station which mentions a series of events starting in 2006 when Surekhaben married Vishnu Desai, a resident of Satellite. Initially, the marriage was harmonious, and the couple was blessed with two sons. However, she alleged that the situation deteriorated due to interference and instigation by her sister-in-law, Chetana, and continued support for such behaviour by her in-laws. Surekha moved out of her matrimonial home in 2014 after facing relentless harassment and took shelter with her parents. Despite repeated reconciliations mediated by community leaders, her husband and in-laws allegedly resumed their abusive behaviour. In her statement, Surekha recounted an incident where she was physically assaulted and thrown out of the house with her children. She also accused her husband and in-laws of making life-threatening threats, including dousing her with kerosene to set her ablaze. The harassment reportedly escalated in 2023, prompting Surekha to file a complaint. However, a temporary truce was reached after her husband apologised. But the abuse resumed, leaving her with no choice but to approach the police again. Surekha has named her husband, father-in-law Bhagwan, mother-in-law Jagaben, and sister-in-law Chetana in the complaint. The allegations include physical assault, mental harassment, and threats to her life. An officer at Vastrapur Police Station confirmed the registration of the case and stated, “We are investigating the matter thoroughly.

Thick plumes of black smoke were visible from several kilometres away, underscoring the intensity of the blaze. The Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) control room received the alert around 1:45 PM. Initially, two fire tenders were dispatched to the site. However, upon arrival, the fire was found to be far more severe than anticipated. The fire spread rapidly due to the presence of highly flammable solvents stored within the factory premises. Realising the gravity of the situation, additional support was called in. A total of 18 fire vehicles, including water tankers and engines, along with 35 firefighters and senior officers, were deployed to contain the inferno. Firefighters worked relentlessly for over four hours to douse the flames, followed by a cooling operation to prevent re-ignition. Speaking about the operation, Divisional Fire Officer Om Jadeja said, “The presence of solvents in the factory posed a significant challenge, but our team acted swiftly. We managed to prevent the fire from spreading to adjacent industrial units, thereby averting a potential disaster.” A 50-year-old man, identified as Shukla, sustained burn injuries to his hand due to exposure to burning chemicals. He was immediately rushed to the hospital for treatment. “Currently, the fire is under control, and the cooling process is ongoing. Once the search operation is complete, we will provide more details regarding any potential casualties,” added Jadeja. While the exact cause of the fire remains under investigation, initial findings suggest that the highly flammable nature of the solvents stored on the premises played a critical role in the rapid escalation of the blaze.

Now, it is crucial for the university to achieve an A++ grade in the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) accreditation, a goal for which the university has been putting in efforts. With many private and government universities in the state already having earned an A++ or A+ grades from National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), Gujarat University is also eying the highest accreditation on offer from the council. Though state’s largest and oldest government university frequently ranks among the top universities of India and globally, securing an A++ grade from NAAC has been a challenge. NAAC’s inspection team is scheduled to visit Gujarat University after January 20. Given the university’s size, the team will consist of five to seven members, and the inspection will last for three days, focusing on various criteria. NAAC has provided the university with a window of two to three dates for the inspection. The last inspection took place in 2015. The five-year validity of Gujarat University’s last NAAC accreditation ended in 2020, but due to the pandemic and other factors, the university did not apply for a new cycle until now. Before that, it was ranked B++ by the NAAC. With the upcoming inspection, along with its consistent national ranking and a 5-star state rating this year, achieving an A++ grade from NAAC has become essential for maintaining the university's reputation.

"Ahmedabad doctor duped of ₹4 crore in ‘digital arrest’ by Indian member of Chinese-Cambodian gang, arrested",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-doctor-duped-rupees-4-crore-digital-arrest-indian-chinese-cambodian-gang,2024-12-12,12,12,2024,"digital arrest In a dramatic twist to a high-profile cyber fraud case, the Gujarat State Cyber Crime Cell arrested a Mumbai-based man accused of being part of a transnational extortion racket. The accused, Chetan Ganpat Kokre, was apprehended from the Gitanagar area of Colaba, Mumbai, in connection with a ₹3.99 crore scam targeting a prominent doctor from Ahmedabad. The doctor, who remains unnamed, was ensnared in a meticulously planned scam in July 2024. Posing as law enforcement officials and corporate representatives, the gang used a fabricated narrative to coerce the victim into believing he was implicated in a criminal case. For ten harrowing days, the gang kept the victim under what they termed “digital arrest”, a nonexistent legal concept, to extort money. According to police officials, Kokre impersonated a FedEx employee and informed the doctor of a suspicious parcel allegedly booked in his name. The parcel purportedly contained items such as passports, credit cards, a laptop, clothes, and 750 grams of MDM (a controlled substance). When the doctor denied any connection to the parcel, the scammer weaponised personal information gleaned from the victim’s social media accounts to lend credibility to their claims. The accused then directed the victim to individuals posing as senior police officers, namely “DCP Anand Rana” and “Milind Barmad” from the Mumbai Crime Branch. These fake officials claimed they were investigating the matter and falsely warned the victim of impending criminal charges. Using Skype calls to maintain anonymity, the gang coerced the victim into a state of panic, threatening him with severe consequences unless he cooperated. Over ten days, the doctor transferred ₹3.99 crore to the scammers, believing it was the only way to clear his name. The Gujarat CID Crime team launched an investigation after the doctor filed a complaint. Technical analysis and electronic trail mapping led them to Kokre, a 27-year-old student residing in Colaba. During the arrest, police recovered two mobile phones, four ATM cards, two credit cards, and four chequebooks. Dharmendra Sharma, Superintendent of Police (CID Crime and Railways), revealed that Kokre was a caller tasked with targeting potential victims. “The gang operates with a team of over 45 members stationed in Cambodia, who impersonate law enforcement officers. Kokre would receive leads on high-profile individuals from a third party. He would then filter targets based on their financial and social backgrounds, using information from social media to execute the fraud,” Sharma said. The Larger Network The investigation has also uncovered the international dimensions of the scam. The Chinese-Cambodian gang allegedly employs a sophisticated network of operatives who work across countries to deceive victims. Authorities are now pursuing leads to identify other members and uncover the full extent of their operations. Beware of the “Digital Arrest” scam Officials have clarified that there is no such legal term as ""digital arrest”. It is a fictitious concept invented by scammers to manipulate victims into believing they are under investigation for fabricated crimes. By creating a sense of urgency and fear, the fraudsters exploit their targets’ vulnerabilities, extorting large sums of money.",ahmedabad

"Speed breakers in Ahmedabad are uneven, improper and faulty, pose serious risk to commuters",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/speed-breakers-in-ahmedabad-are-uneven-improper-and-faulty-pose-serious-risk-to-commuters,2024-12-12,12,12,2024,"Speed breakers are installed on roads as a safety measure for vehicles to slow down and reduce accidents. However, they are increasingly becoming a danger rather than a protective measure. Incidents caused by improperly designed speed bumps have caused more harm than good. Recently, an unmarked speed breaker in Gurugram sent cars ‘flying’, raising concerns of safety and creating significant risks for drivers. Taking a cue from this incident, Gujarat Samachar Digital took a test drive across the city to find out if speed breakers were made as per specifications and adhered to the Indian Road Congress (IRC) guidelines. We covered several high-traffic areas, including S G Highway, Drive-in Road, AMC to Vasna Road, and Jamalpur. What the team found was concerning: several speed breakers were either uneven in size, improperly constructed, or damaged. These faulty speed bumps not only disrupt the smooth flow of traffic but also pose severe danger to commuters. We found that none of the speed breakers met the crucial safety standards. Instead, many bumps lacked proper markings, and some were constructed unevenly, creating a hazardous situation for both vehicles and pedestrians. As per the IRC, speed bumps must be clearly marked with triangular warning signs, and zebra crossings should be distinctly painted with black-and-white stripes to differentiate them from bumps. Dr Praveen Kanabar, president of the Ahmedabad Traffic Consultative Committee, highlighted the importance of these regulations, stating, “Speed bumps should have triangular signs placed at least 100 metres ahead of the bump. In addition, the bump itself should be painted with triangles to ensure better visibility.” Dr Kanabar also emphasised the risks posed when speed bumps and zebra crossings are not clearly distinguishable. “If commuters cannot tell the difference between a speed bump and a zebra crossing, it can lead to serious accidents. This also puts pedestrians at risk, as they may mistakenly think they are crossing at a zebra crossing when they are not,” he explained. One group that is especially vulnerable to these poorly constructed speed breakers are two-wheelers. Unlike four-wheelers, which can handle bumps and uneven surfaces more smoothly, two-wheelers are at a greater risk of losing balance or falling when encountering an uneven or poorly constructed speed breaker. The sudden impact caused by an unmarked or damaged speed bump can cause two-wheeler riders to lose control, leading to accidents, falls, and even serious injuries. Even for cars, uneven or excessively high speed breakers can cause damage to the suspension system and affect the vehicle’s overall performance, leading to costly repairs. According to Dr Kanabar, Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is responsible for maintaining and ensuring the safety of speed breakers on the city’s roads. Mirant Parikh, Deputy Municipal Commissioner of AMC, stated, “We have already issued an Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to the respective Additional Engineers regarding speed breakers. All new speed bumps will be constructed following IRC standard guidelines, and the installation process has already begun. In addition, we will analyse the existing speed breakers. Those requiring thermoplastic markings or reconstruction will be modified and redone. Furthermore, we will install warning sign boards near speed breakers to ensure commuters are aware of their presence. We aim to complete this process within the next two months.” Also read : Six people die in separate accidents on Diwali in Gujarat",ahmedabad
Gang that honey-trapped senior insurance manager nabbed by Ahmedabad Rural Police,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/honey-trapping-gang-nabbed-by-ahmedabad-rural-police,2024-12-12,12,12,2024,"A gang of five, including two women, was arrested by Ahmedabad Rural Police for honey-trapping a man from the Chandkheda area of the city. They tricked him into a trap near Nalsarovar by claiming to be police officers and threatened to file a false case against him. The victim, a 45-year-old senior manager at an insurance company in Chandkheda, had downloaded a mobile app a few months ago to make new friends. Through the app, he came into contact with a woman named Ziya Patel, who expressed interest in meeting him. On November 22, he drove to Ujjala Circle to meet her, and they planned to go to a hotel on the Rajkot highway. However, Ziya insisted that he drive towards Nalsarovar instead. Once they reached a specific location, she asked him to stop the car. At that point, a man approached them, introduced himself as a police officer, and took their phones and purse. He threatened the victim with a police case, demanding a ransom of ₹1 lakh to avoid it. The victim, who had four debit and credit cards, handed them over. The man then took the cards, learned the PIN (Personal Identification Number), and left with another accomplice. Ziya Patel pretended to be scared, making the victim believe she was innocent. Meanwhile, the gang used the cards to buy jewellery worth over ₹4 lakh and withdrew ₹62,000 in cash. When the victim filed a complaint at the Nalsarovar police station, the police began investigating using technical analysis. They arrested five members of the gang: Janki Upara, Nasir Jasraya, Kausar Pinjara, Raj Kotai (all from Swaminarayan Society in Jamnagar), and Sahil Vaghela (from New Thorala, Rajkot). Police seized the stolen jewellery and cash from them. Preliminary investigations revealed that this gang has been involved in similar honey-trapping incidents, extorting large sums from several people.

The complaint was registered at the local police station, narrating years of torment following her marriage in June 2022. According to the complainant, Varnika Sharma, a dental student, met her husband, Manoj Chaudhary, through social media in 2022. Their relationship culminated in a love marriage solemnised at the Arya Samaj temple in Noida. Initially, she was treated well in her matrimonial home in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh.

In her statement, Varnika alleged that her mother-in-law, Savitri Devi Chaudhary, her husband Manoj, and other family members, including her brother-in-law Neeraj and sister-in-law Neha, demanded ₹25 lakh in cash and an Innova car. She recounted that she was subjected to verbal taunts, physical assault, and mental harassment when these demands were not fulfilled. Varnika also alleged that her brother-in-law made inappropriate advances toward her, and when she resisted, the family united in further mistreating her. She revealed that her husband would return home intoxicated and abuse her verbally and physically. The tipping point came on November 6, 2024, when Varnika was allegedly beaten by the family and thrown out of the house without her belongings.

Notably, Chavda, who died on December 9 in police custody, is accused of killing 13 people including Nagma, with the use of sodium nitrate. In March 2024, Nagma was killed at a house in Wadhwan, and her body parts were disposed of near Dhamalpur, Wankaner. After four hours of excavation by the Ahmedabad and Rajkot police, Nagma’s body parts were recovered and sent for forensic examination. Police are also investigating the suspicious deaths of her mother, father, and brother, with the possibility that these deaths could be connected to the same case. Ahmedabad police will send all the details to Rajkot police for further investigation. According to sources from Wankaner police, the remains found included parts of the head, legs, arms, and abdomen. These remains were wrapped in plastic and in a cloth bag.

Further investigations revealed that 62-year-old Kadar Ali Mukasam from Rajkot, a relative of Nagma, had approached Navalsinh seeking a solution to his problems. In May of this year, the bodies of Kadar, his wife Farida, and their son Asif were found in a car abandoned in a forest near Mota Rampur village. Initially, the police had concluded that it was a case of suicide. Also read : Tantric learnt use of sodium nitrate 15 years ago from ‘guru’ in Ujjain",ahmedabad
Ruckus over steep hike in toll tax on Ahmedabad-Rajkot highway,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/demand-of-higher-than-normal-toll-leads-to-commotion-on-ahmedabad-rajkot-highway,2024-12-12,12,12,2024,"A major commotion unfolded at the Bamanbor toll plaza from Ahmedabad to Rajkot when a truck driver was asked to pay ₹1,210 instead of the ₹84 toll. Transporters from Rajkot rushed to the toll plaza to protest the incident, prompting the toll operators to flee the scene. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday around 4 pm, resulted in many vehicles crowding the toll plaza area. After passing Bagodara, the truck driver was asked to pay ₹1,126 in addition to the ₹84 toll. This led to an uproar. The area between Bagodara and Bamanbor where several industrial units fall on the way, is prone to heavy vehicle traffic. Normally, a toll of ₹84 is collected at both Bagodara and Bamanbor. At the Bamanbor toll plaza, ₹84 was deducted from the truck’s FASTag account for one-way travel. However, the toll operators, under the name of ‘M/s Preeti Builders, Nagpur’, demanded an additional ₹1,000 per truck and even issued receipts in the builder's name. For vehicles with three to six axles, an additional ₹126 was also collected, apart from the ₹1,000. Usually, for a round trip, ₹126 (₹84 for onward and ₹42 for return) is charged. However, in this case, vehicles travelling one way were also charged for a return trip. In addition to the ₹126, another ₹1,000 was demanded. Transporters claimed that the Gujarat government had previously issued instructions exempting passenger vehicles from toll charges on all state highways. However, commercial vehicles continue to pay tolls. The chaotic situation at the Bamanbor toll plaza drew the attention of officials from the Roads and Buildings Department, who reportedly requested the transporters not to escalate the matter further. In response to the protests, the toll plaza staff abandoned their posts. The incident highlights concerns over alleged misconduct by toll operators and raises questions about the transparency of toll collections on Gujarat’s highways.

The owner, Mahesh Chunara, a  realty broker and resident of the apartment complex, filed a complaint with the Anand Nagar police station on Thursday. Chunara stated that he parked the blue 2019 model SUV, bearing a GJ-01 registration, in the building’s parking area on December 3. He noticed the car missing on the morning of December 6. After confirming with his wife that it had not been lent out, Chunara conducted a search in the vicinity before approaching the police. Investigations have revealed that the car was allegedly stolen by Vishal Gala, a friend of Chunara, using a duplicate key. The vehicle had been purchased in 2019 through a loan registered under Neha Gala, Vishal’s wife, due to loan eligibility constraints. Despite the loan and associated taxes being paid in full by Chunara, Gala reportedly withheld the No Objection Certificate (NOC), citing additional monetary demands. Speaking on the case, Inspector VJ Desai of Anandnagar Police said, “We have documents proving that Chunara paid the loan amount and taxes, which establish his ownership of the car, even though it is registered under Neha Gala’s name. Despite this, Vishal was demanding more money from Chunara and refused to hand over the NOC.” CCTV footage from the apartment complex revealed that Vishal Gala stole the car around 4 am on December 6. Further inquiries found that he visited a Mercedes showroom later that day to deactivate the vehicle’s remaining keys. The showroom staff reportedly alerted Gala about the action, complicating the situation further. Police have identified the accused and are actively working to apprehend him. “We have substantial evidence, including the CCTV footage and financial documents, and we expect to take the accused into custody soon,” added Inspector Desai. Additionally, authorities discovered that Vishal Gala is also under investigation in a separate cheating case lodged with the Ahmedabad Cyber Cell in 2022.

PIL in Guj HC over Panjrapol flyover seeks removal of blacklisted builder,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/no-need-for-panjrapol-flyover-till-2044,2024-12-14,14,12,2024,"A public interest litigation (PIL) filed in Gujarat High Court over the proposed flyover from Panjarapol to IIM in Ahmedabad, other than issues of traffic and increasing accidents, has raised serious questions about the builder who was blacklisted yet awarded the contract. Citing a report from experts, senior counsel Mihir Thakor, representing the petitioner, said that considering the gradual and continuous decline in traffic on this road, there is no need for a flyover till 2044. The report, according to Thakor, indicated that in 2012, around 10,000 vehicles passed through this road, which reduced to 8,582 in 2020 and to around 6,000 in 2024. The authorities have proposed a flyover project based on the possibility of increasing traffic on this road in the future, but the reality is that the number of vehicles on this road has reduced significantly. He argued that if more than 1,00,000 vehicles are passing daily, the need for a bridge arises. Also, the construction of a bridge will create a situation where large fire brigade vehicles would not be able to pass. Moreover, the Lokayukt had issued an order against the contractor Ranjit Buildcon, to whom AMC has awarded the contract for the flyover. The firm was also blacklisted earlier, yet the AMC handed the contract to one of the companies of the same group, Thakor argued. He pointed out that nine contracts associated with the group have failed and serious incidents including human deaths have also come to light due to the negligence of the contractor. So, in public interest, they should not be given the project. After hearing the petitioner, the court scheduled further hearing in the case for next week.

Highlighting his ‘magical experience’ of direction, he says, “Being an engineer, a technical guy, the sound designing, editing and lighting worked for me.” “It took me more than two years to decide the look and sound, and I feel what I couldn’t do all these years, I have poured it into this film,” he concluded with a smile. Describing the story behind ‘FATEH’, Sood said that it is about a common man who faces and fights serious issues like cybercrime. Fateh is a bold narrative that explores the dangers of the digital age while delivering a gripping cinematic experience. Showing his quirky side while talking to Gujarat Samachar Digital , Sood said, “As my wife is one of the producers of Fateh, we had no budget constraints”. Sood jokingly added, “Wallet de diya wife ne, aur kaha jao karo kharcha!!” Gujarat is mind-blowing: Sonu Sood “Mind-blowing,” Sood said when asked about Gujarat state. “The people and food here are lovely.” Sood addressed the dangers of social media and explained it is important to use the digital space wisely including applications, deep fakes, AI, and other loan apps. “Financial scams and looting make daily headlines, and people are dying because of that. I think we should learn how to use the internet and social media wisely,” he added. Sood, the pandemic messiah The actor-turned-director is known for his philanthropic efforts since the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020. “Even today, after 4.5 years, 400-500 people visit my house daily, whether from Andhra, Telangana, Gujarat, Bihar, or anywhere in the country,” said Sood. “They come with hope. I always say – “hope and effort” are very powerful words. If no one has hope in you, then your life is meaningless. And if you cannot make an effort for someone, that is also meaningless,” said Sood with an innocent smirk. During the shoot of Fateh as well, the production team developed a school in a village in Punjab where the first scene was shot. Moreover, every single day of the film’s shoot, 500 underprivileged people were fed in the respective cities where it was shot. ‘Dune’ vocalist chips in for Fateh Grammy-nominated artist Loire Cotler, known for her work in ‘Dune’, has composed a song called ‘Call to Life’ for Sood’s directorial debut. “Tamne badhane Jan 10 na Fateh movie jovanu chhe” Lastly, with all his charisma, Sood urged Amdavadis in Gujarati to watch Fateh, releasing on January 10, 2025.

Illicit gas cylinder refilling scam uncovered in Ahmedabad,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/illicit-gas-cylinder-refilling-uncovered-in-ahmedabad,2024-12-17,17,12,2024,"The vigilance teams of gas agencies uncovered a scam involving the illegal refilling of cooking gas cylinders and selling them at inflated prices in Ahmedabad. The gas companies received a complaint about illegal refilling of cylinders in the Riverfront East area at Chamunda Nagar in Ahmedabad. The modus operandi of the scam involved employees from Bharat Petroleum, Indian Oil, and Hindustan Petroleum, companies that supply domestic cooking gas. These employees would take cylinders to residences in Chamunda Nagar, remove the seals, steal 1.5 to 2 kg of gas from each cylinder, and then reseal them. The stolen gas would be used to fill other cylinders, which were then sold in the black market for a hefty price of ₹2,000 each. Allegedly, up to 100 cylinders were refilled and sold daily. The names of the residents involved in the scam in Chamunda Nagar have been revealed. Investigations will also be conducted into the employees of the gas companies, and a police complaint will be filed.

"Traffic violators, beware! Ahmedabad police now uses POS machines to collect fines on the spot",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/traffic-violators-beware-ahmedabad-police-now-uses-pos-machines-to-collect-fines-on-the-spot,2024-12-18,18,12,2024,"To enhance and ease traffic fine collection, the Ahmedabad Traffic Police has introduced 250 new Point of Sale (POS) machines across the city. These devices have been distributed to the city’s 14 traffic police stations and have been in use for the past month to generate challans and recover fines on the spot. As part of a broader initiative by the state traffic department, a total of 500 machines have been allocated across four major cities, including Ahmedabad. The new system aims to eliminate common excuses such as lack of cash or issues with online payments, ensuring violators can pay fines on the spot. For years, Ahmedabad’s Traffic Police have relied on digital tools like CCTV cameras, speed guns, and dashcams to identify violators. With the introduction of POS machines, fines can now be paid on the spot through cash, credit/debit cards, or QR codes, significantly improving recovery rates. Head constables and assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) have been trained to operate the machines efficiently. According to senior officials, the new POS machines are equipped with advance features, including cameras to capture images of violators and QR codes for seamless digital transactions. They also support ATM card swipes, offering multiple payment options. This is not the first time POS machines have been introduced, a similar initiative six years ago failed due to operational challenges. At the time, around 20-25 machines were provided to the department on a trial basis. However, technical issues in generating challans and delays in payment processing led to the machines being withdrawn and never fully implemented. This time, the department is focused on addressing past shortcomings, ensuring that the machines are fully utilised to achieve their intended purpose. By streamlining the fine collection process, the Ahmedabad Traffic Police aims to reinforce compliance and improve efficiency in managing traffic violations.",ahmedabad

The initiative, which has been ongoing for the past three years, aims to incorporate the voices of citizens before finalising key allocations for the city’s development. Citizens of Ahmedabad have come forward with several requests, ranging from improved infrastructure to social welfare initiatives. Among the notable suggestions, auto rickshaw drivers have requested permission to operate their vehicles on the Riverfront Road, a move aimed at easing transportation in the area. Here’s a look at some of the key wishes shared by Amdavadis: Designate a car-free day Decide on one day each week when no cars are allowed on the roads, and everyone should use public transport on that day. Swachh Ahmedabad initiative Declare the last Sunday of every month as “Swachh Ahmedabad” for a city-wide cleanliness drive. Rainwater management Provide facilities that direct rainwater into lakes to prevent waterlogging and enhance water conservation. Auto-rickshaw and road space Due to the traffic caused by auto rickshaws, the free left turn lanes are ineffective. More space should be allocated for better traffic management. CG road improvements Extend the road and create proper parking facilities along CG Road to alleviate congestion. Penalty for spitting in public spaces Imposing an immediate fine on individuals who spit in public areas to maintain cleanliness.

Boarding a flight to Mumbai or Delhi, and then flying from there to their preferred international destination, helps the flyers, in some cases, to save up to 30% on the fares. There are fewer direct international flights from Ahmedabad, primarily due to the high fares. A difference of at least ₹30,000 is often noted between direct flights and via flights from Ahmedabad. As a result, direct international flights don’t attract enough passengers. For instance, a direct flight from Ahmedabad to Toronto costs ₹83,780 with taxes, whereas the combined fare of Ahmedabad to Mumbai and Mumbai to Toronto comes close to ₹50,000. Similarly, flying via Delhi is also cheaper. A flight from Ahmedabad to Delhi, and from Delhi to Toronto costs a total of ₹67,360, which is still significantly less than the direct flight from Ahmedabad to Toronto. Passengers tend to opt for these via flights more often. To increase international passenger traffic at Ahmedabad airport, flyers are hoping that reduction in fares for direct flights.

In Ahmedabad’s South-West Zone, in the Prahladnagar area, the municipal authorities have constructed an eight-storey multilevel parking facility at a cost of ₹76 crore. Attempts to sell the properties within this facility were made twice previously, but they were unsuccessful. Consequently, the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Standing Committee has approved a new proposal to auction these properties. After such a significant investment, the Standing Committee Chairman Devang Dani remarked that if ‘buyers cannot be found, then such projects should be discontinued’. AMC officials had presented the idea of multi level parking to the ruling party as a solution to ease traffic issues. However, prior experiences with projects like Navrangpura multilevel parking and Kankaria multilevel parking, which involved investments of crores of rupees, revealed that there were no takers for the properties in those facilities. Despite these setbacks, an eight-storey multilevel parking structure was constructed in Prahladnagar. Now, the municipal authorities are facing significant challenges in selling these properties. This multilevel parking facility, which includes commercial spaces, was initially priced by the corporation’s valuation committee at ₹4.3 lakh per square metre. However, after two failed attempts to sell the spaces, the price was reduced to ₹3.96 lakh per square metre. Despite the reduction, doubts remain about whether these properties will sell. In the same area, the maximum jantri (government-declared property rate) is expected to reach ₹1.03 lakh starting April 2025. Standing Committee Chairman Dani criticised the situation, stating that such projects should be reconsidered if the properties fail to sell after such a large investment.

Gujarat High Court clerk narrowly escapes parcel bomb attack,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-high-court-clerk-narrowly-escapes-parcel-bomb,2024-12-21,21,12,2024,"In a fresh development, it has come to light that a high court clerk narrowly escaped a targeted parcel bomb attack allegedly orchestrated by Rupen Barot to settle a personal grudge. The plan went awry when Barot prematurely detonated the bomb using a remote control, causing it to explode in the hands of the courier. The blast left the courier with severe injuries, injured two others, and triggered panic in the neighbourhood. Grudge over divorce sparks deadly plot Preliminary investigations revealed that Barot held a grudge against high court clerk Baldev Sukhadia, whom he blamed for his ongoing divorce proceedings with his wife Hetal. Hetal, who was training as a lawyer under Baldev's guidance, had previously developed a professional relationship with him. Seeking revenge, Barot reportedly crafted the bomb at home and enlisted an acquaintance to deliver it. On Friday evening, a youth arrived at Gadhvi’s residence with the parcel, claiming it was sent by ‘Sureshbhai’. Suspicious, Gadhvi asked the courier to confirm the sender’s details over the phone. When the courier insisted the parcel must be accepted, smoke suddenly began to emanate from the package. Moments later, the bomb exploded, injuring the courier. Police probe uncovers illegal arms manufacturing Following the explosion, police officers, led by senior officials, launched a thorough investigation. Gadhvi named Rupen Barot as a suspect, citing his previous threats related to the divorce. A subsequent raid at Barot’s house in Godavari Apartments, Chandkheda, uncovered bomb-making materials, three country-made pistols, and evidence suggesting a well-planned attack. Investigators discovered that Barot was involved in manufacturing single-shot country-made pistols at home. The recovered pistols were confirmed to have been crafted by him. Police suspect Barot was selling these weapons on demand. The extent of his illegal activities, including the number of firearms sold, is under investigation. Illegal liquor trade and gig economy involvement Further inquiries revealed that Barot and his associate smuggled illicit liquor (IMFL) from Rajasthan, which they sold to sustain themselves. During their free time, they reportedly provided two-wheeler taxi services through an app-based platform (Rapido). Professional help suspected in bomb creation The bomb's sophisticated design featuring shards of glass, razor blades, and ball bearings has led police to suspect Barot had professional assistance in its construction. Investigators believe Barot may have made these connections while serving a previous jail sentence. Courier interrogated for leads The injured courier, identified as Gaurav Gadhvi, disclosed during questioning that he was recruited by Barot’s associate, Rohan Rawal. Gaurav, who lost his job at ONGC and now works at a garage, was promised substantial payment for delivering the parcel. Barot and Rawal monitored the delivery attempt from a nearby rickshaw. Believing the parcel had reached Gadhvi, Barot detonated the bomb remotely. Primary suspect’s criminal history Rupen Barot has a history of criminal activity, including multiple cases related to gambling and prohibition violations. He has previously served a sentence under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities (PASA) Act. Barot was also involved in duplicate IMFL manufacturing case in the past and was arrested by police in the matter. Potential catastrophe averted Police noted that the bomb could have caused significant casualties if it had exploded inside Gadhvi’s residence. The Crime Branch is actively investigating Barot’s connections, his criminal network, and the source of the explosive materials.",ahmedabad

Shah accused builder Saleem Pathan of constructing a complex on the land where the Amdavad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) Urdu school stood, near the Jamalpur Kanch mosque. Shah made the accusation during a meeting chaired by Municipal Commissioner M Thennarasan, which also included MPs and MLAs. Shah explained that 20 years ago, the Urdu school, which had around 200 students, was closed by the Municipal School Board. After the closure, Saleem Jumma Khan Pathan, who lived nearby, allegedly constructed 10 illegal shops and started collecting a rent of ₹12,000. ‘I will resign if school is closed’ When Shah sought to know about the school’s current state, an official confirmed that it had been closed. The MLA responded and demanded a thorough investigation. “The municipal school was replaced by a shopping centre. I request a thorough investigation. If the school is closed, I will resign as MLA.” He claimed that the authorities were unaware of the shopping centre and should take action. Whether the complex should be demolished is a separate issue, but he stressed that the corporation must be informed. The construction of the complex, which involved demolishing the school and cutting down old trees surrounding the area, was opposed by local residents, who filed complaints with government departments. People also approached the local MLA’s office to raise the issue, but no action was taken. Both school sites are worth millions of rupees.

Bengaluru engineer Atul Subhash had died by suicide after alleging in a video post about harassment and false accusations by his wife and in-laws. Around 40 people participated in the rally, organised by Samanta Foundation, Gujarat, starting from the Collector’s Office to RTO Circle, and held a two-minute silence in memory of ‘martyrs of marriage’.

According to National Crime Records Bureau data, as many as 1,22,724 men die by suicide annually, a statistic organisers believe underscores the dire need for laws that are not biased against men. The participants emphasised that such laws cause undue harassment to innocent men and their families, urging the government to prioritise amendments and create gender-neutral legislation. In addition, the event called for the establishment of a ‘Men’s Commission’, akin to the Nation Commission for Women, animals, and trees.

Local councillors claimed that there are many schools in the area but the lack of security personnel has allowed anti-social elements to loiter around the school premises. The area houses five different schools including Urdu Secondary and Higher Secondary School, Rakhial Gujarati Shala No. 1/2, Rakhial Urdu Shala No. 1, Bapunagar Hindi Municipal Secondary School, and Rakhial English Medium School. Approximately 2,500 students from Gomtipur, Bapunagar, Saraspur, and nearby areas attend these schools. In January, AMC made a drastic decision to build a wall dividing the campus into two sections. As a result, f the secondary and higher secondary schools now operate on one side. Despite having around 720 students in the secondary division, the entire campus has only one security guard. This lack of security has allowed external miscreants to loom around the school premises. Incidents of harassment involving female students have been reported frequently. Principals have lodged multiple complaints at the local police station. The growing fear has led many parents to withdraw their daughters from school. Local councillors have urged the municipal commissioner to provide adequate security guards across the campus to prevent any major incidents.

The Crime Branch suspects that the vandalism was an extension of this ongoing conflict. JCP Sharad Singhal stated, “The accused were involved in a previous altercation with the Nadia community, and the damage to the statue seems to stem from that history. Further details will emerge following the interrogation of the arrested individuals.” The Khokhra Police are now leading the investigation, and updates are expected as more evidence and testimonies come to light.",ahmedabad

Upon reaching the scene, the police found that the statue's nose and glasses had been defaced.

Preliminary police investigations suggest that the act was deliberate, likely intended to provoke communal discord. The incident is believed to have occurred before 8.47 am. Residents expressed deep concern over the act and its potential repercussions, though they stated they were unaware of the perpetrator's identity. “We have registered a complaint under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including those addressing offences against public tranquility and promoting enmity between groups,” stated Police Inspector N K Rabari. Local leaders and activists demanded swift action against those responsible. “Dr Ambedkar’s statue is a symbol of equality and justice. Such acts of vandalism are intolerable and must be addressed with the utmost seriousness,” said a prominent community leader. The vandalism prompted a large crowd to gather at the site in protest, with many voicing their anger and frustration over the attack on social harmony. In response, the Khokhra police deployed a team to manage the situation and launch an investigation into the matter. Community leaders and police officials have urged residents to remain calm and let the law take its course. The area around the statue has been cordoned off as a precautionary measure, with additional police personnel deployed to prevent any escalation of tensions. Efforts are underway to identify and apprehend the culprits, as residents and leaders alike call for justice and the restoration of peace in the community.

The government of Gujarat and its tourism department are also busy promoting ecotourism in the state. However, the halted services of  boating at Nal Sarovar has curbed the employment opportunities for people of over 15 surrounding villages. The boating was stopped at the lake after the Harni boat tragedy in Vadodara, taking away earning opportunities from people of Viramgam, Limbdi, Bavla, and other places. The people from surrounding villages depended on boating and food stalls at the lake for their earning. With no boats operating in the lake, the students, birdwatchers, and tourists have been unable to get up close with the birds. Villagers reportedly claimed that since for the most part, the lake has shallow waters, so stopping the boating activities in te name of safety does not make sense. The villagers demand a clearer guideline from the government and tourism department to clear the employment issues faced by the villagers. Last year, 3.20 lakh migratory birds of 140 species arrived at Nal Sarovar, which is spread over the circumference of over 120 km. In the same duration, 61,000 tourists visited the lake.

Under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Employment Scheme, companies attempted to take advantage of the contributions from both employees and employers. However, even after four years, the unique account numbers of thousands of employees remain inactive. As a result, employees are unable to verify whether their companies are depositing the provident fund (PF) contributions into their accounts. They also cannot check the balance of their PF accounts, nor can they withdraw the accumulated funds, even in times of urgent need. An investigation and inspections were conducted regarding this fraud. The accounts, frozen in October 2023, are yet to be activated. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the central government launched the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme to help companies and employees by contributing to the provident fund. Some companies took advantage of this scheme. When the government discovered that companies were committing fraud, it froze the unique account numbers of the companies and employees involved. The government then initiated an investigation. It was found that the owners had created bogus companies, fabricated employee lists, and deposited both the employee's share and the company’s contribution to the provident fund. These lists were later discovered to be fake. The inspectors in Ahmedabad, who were held responsible, have submitted their report to the Delhi office. However, no solution has been provided so far.

Retired govt employee loses ₹22 lakh in cyber fraud by scammers posing as BoI officials,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/retired-govt-employee-loses-rs-22-lakh-in-cyber-fraud-by-scammers-posing-as-boi-officials,2024-12-27,27,12,2024,"A retired resident of Vejalpur in Ahmedabad, Pravinkant S Patel, was duped of ₹22.2 lakh by scammers posing as representatives of Bank of India. The incident occurred between November 5 and 6, when the victim unwittingly provided sensitive bank account information via a fraudulent mobile application. The retired government employee received a message on WhatsApp from an unknown number claiming to be from the Bank of India. The message, titled ‘Bank of India Aadhaar Update’, urged customers to update their Aadhaar details to prevent their bank accounts from being blocked. The scammers attached an APK file (a mobile application) disguised as an official Bank of India app. Trusting the message’s authenticity, Patel downloaded the application and entered his details, including his name, mobile number, and bank account details. Within hours, a series of unauthorised transactions drained ₹22.2 lakh from his account through UPI and NEFT transfers. As per the police, the fraudulent transactions were carried out in quick succession, transferring amounts of ₹25,000 and ₹50,000 to various accounts. Upon realising the suspicious activity, Patel attempted to contact his bank but was unable to halt the transfers. The next morning, when he visited his branch, he discovered that even his fixed deposits had been liquidated and transferred to unauthorised accounts via overdraft accounts opened without his consent. Senior police officials stated, “The victim believed the application was legitimate because it displayed the Bank of India logo and name. He was afraid that his account would be blocked if he did not act quickly. By the time he realised the fraud, it was too late.” The City Cyber Cell Police has registered a complaint under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act and have obtained the WhatsApp messages, transaction details, and other evidence to track the perpetrators. Authorities are also investigating whether the fraudsters had inside access to the victim’s banking information and whether the fraudulent application was used in other cases. The police have issued a warning to citizens to exercise caution while dealing with unsolicited messages, especially those requiring personal or financial details. - Do not download APK files or applications from unverified sources. - Avoid sharing sensitive information like Aadhaar details or bank account numbers online. - Contact your bank directly if you receive such messages.

"Ahmedabad firm’s shares soar 1700% in a year, operators allegedly laundered ₹10,000 cr black money",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-firms-shares-soar-1700-in-a-year-operators-allegedly-laundered-10-000-cr-black-money,2024-12-27,27,12,2024,"A scam has come to light in the case of unprecedented rise in the shares of Bharat Global Developers Limited, based in Ahmedabad and listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. It is alleged that black money worth around ₹10,000 crore was laundered in this case. A potential case for the Income Tax and Enforcement Directorate (ED) to carry out investigation into the conversion of black money into white. SEBI’s preliminary report exposes the scam In October 2024, it was announced that top industrial houses like Reliance, Tata, McCain, and UPL had placed orders worth ₹1500 crore with Bharat Global Developers. This led to an unprecedented surge in the company’s share price. Between November 2023 and November 2024, the share price shot up by 1700%. According to SEBI’s preliminary report, operators carried out internal buying and selling by making a series of announcements and talking about a golden future, thus increasing the share price. They then sold the shares at a higher price and made a hefty profit of ₹271 crore. Market sources believe that around ₹10,000 crore of black money was transacted in this 1700% rise in the share price of this company in one year, and the operators pocketed it. After SEBI’s preliminary investigation report, the Income Tax and ED are likely to investigate and expose the entire scam. An operator known as ‘Kaliya’ in the local stock market played a key role in the scam of this shell company. It is being rumoured that this operator has special connections with a minister in Delhi, so allegedly there will be no investigation into the entire scam. However, it has also been learned that after SEBI’s order, Kaliya has switched off his mobile and is making arrangements to flee. Earlier, cases have been registered against these operators for manipulating share prices in various SEBI cases. Market cap of shell company reaches ₹13,000 crore The operator and his accomplices took control of all the shares of a shell company, spread rumours about a golden future for the company, and created a company with a market cap of ₹13,000 crore in just one year. Shares worth ₹500 crore were sold to small investors at inflated prices. It was announced that the company would issue bonuses and interim dividends. However, before that, the scam was exposed, and now the operators have gone underground. Four times company name changed Originally registered as Perfect Divers in 1992, the company changed its name four times. The company has changed its original business of textiles to construction, infrastructure, and new energy projects. It also created a series of subsidiaries and announced extensive expansion. On the other hand, in a planned conspiracy to launder black money, the black operator and his accomplices allotted preferential shares to them at ₹10 in March 2024 and at ₹ 121 in October 2024. In addition, 99% of the shares were allotted to the operators instead of the promoters in one go. If only a few people in the market have shares, it becomes easy to manipulate prices. SEBI’s interim order In an interim order on Monday, SEBI banned the trading of the company’s shares and also banned 41 operators and their accomplices and initiated further investigation. According to SEBI’s interim order, these operators have made a profit of ₹271.58 crore in the trading of this share and have pocketed it.

The alleged fraud has left the complainant and others poorer by ₹56 lakh. The accused, identified as Yash Bulchandani and Neel Mehta, reportedly convinced the complainant Deepak Shah and several others to invest in the stock market, promising lucrative monthly returns and assured repayment of the principal amount. Shah, a resident of Isanpur, claimed he was introduced to the accused in May 2022 through a mutual acquaintance Vaibhav Modi. As per police, Shah alleged that he had initially invested ₹10 lakh in June 2022, signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Bulchandani at his office in Ratnakar Nine Square, Ahmedabad.

AMC withdraws charge sheet against 22 inspectors over BU permission to gaming zones,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/amc-withdraws-charge-sheet-against-22-inspectors-over-bu-permission-to-gaming-zones,2024-12-28,28,12,2024,"Following the fire incident at a gaming zone that claimed 33 lives in Rajkot, building use permission granted to gaming zones in Ahmedabad had come under the scanner. . Senior officials of the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had filed a chargesheet against 22 inspectors, blaming them for not properly verifying the gaming zones in the city before issuing the BU permission. However, after a review by an investigation committee, the charge sheet was withdrawn on Monday, as the evidence presented was found to be baseless. Interestingly, the investigation committee’s report made no mention of any issue related to building use permission. Despite this, the charge sheet was filed, citing building use violations as the basis for pinning the blame on  the inspectors. The high-ranking AMC officials appeared to be trying to cover up their own inaction by passing the buck on the inspectors. When some of the inspectors had the chance to cross-examine the committee members, they questioned the findings of the investigation report. In response, the committee admitted that the report did not address the building use permission issue, thereby proving the charge sheet invalid. It was also noted that both the deputy municipal commissioner and the assistant municipal commissioner were equally responsible for granting the building use permission, but they were not held accountable. Instead, the blame was placed on the inspectors. The controversy surfaced after the fire incident in Rajkot, which led to the closure of several gaming zones in Gujarat.

"Year-end shock: Over 9,800 fake notes worth ₹43.11 lakh recovered in Ahmedabad banks",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/year-end-shock-over-9-800-fake-notes-worth-43-11-lakh-recovered-in-ahmedabad-banks,2024-12-31,31,12,2024,"Ahmedabad’s Special Operations Group (SOG) has uncovered a significant counterfeit currency racket. The investigation, spanning months, has led to the recovery of 9,837 fake currency notes of various denominations in 2024. These notes, detected primarily when unsuspecting individuals attempted to deposit them in banks, amount to a total of ₹43.11 lakh. The case sheds light on a pressing issue in India’s financial system: counterfeit currency infiltrating the market and going unnoticed until random detection. The investigation was initiated earlier this year after multiple banks, including ICICI, Axis, HDFC, Yes Bank, and SBI, reported suspicious notes. These notes were identified based on discrepancies in texture, colour, and serial numbers. Bank officials promptly sealed the questionable notes and forwarded them to the Ahmedabad Police Commissioner’s office and the Joint Commissioner of Police for further scrutiny. The breakdown of the seized counterfeit notes is as follows: ₹2000 notes: 915 pieces ₹500 notes: 3,744 pieces ₹200 notes: 1,261 pieces ₹100 notes: 3,251 pieces ₹50 notes: 647 pieces ₹20 notes: 14 pieces ₹10 notes: 5 pieces Modus operandi The counterfeit currency appears to have been manufactured with an alarming level of precision, mimicking genuine notes to deceive unsuspecting recipients. The investigation is yet to uncover any organised chain or network responsible for the circulation of these fake notes. Instead, the notes remained largely detected when common citizens unknowingly attempted to deposit them in banks in small amounts. This modus operandi suggests a decentralised and covert circulation strategy. Investigators speculate that the notes were likely introduced into the system through legitimate business transactions and retail payments, thereby bypassing traditional detection mechanisms. Police action and forensic analysis The seized counterfeit notes have been meticulously catalogued and stored in secure, transparent plastic containers. Forensic experts are now analysing these notes to determine their origin and manufacturing techniques. Meanwhile, the SOG has obtained relevant documents from the banks involved in tracing any potential leads that might expose the people behind this operation. Legal proceedings have been initiated under Sections 485, 486, and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, which address counterfeiting currency and criminal conspiracy. The police are also collaborating with banking officials and cyber experts to probe deeper into the network. A systemic challenge The recovery of over 9,800 fake notes in a single year highlights a glaring vulnerability in the financial system. With the Reserve Bank of India and commercial banks investing heavily in detection mechanisms, the persistence of counterfeit currency underscores the need for enhanced measures. The absence of an identifiable network or chain complicates the situation. Unlike traditional counterfeit operations where investigators can trace a clear distribution route, these notes surface occasionally, often through individuals unaware of their illegitimacy. This pattern necessitates a multi-pronged approach involving public awareness, improved security features in currency notes, and advanced technology for detection.

Ruling govt complaints of illegal construction despite being in rule for two decades,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ruling-govt-complaints-of-illegal-construction-despite-being-in-rule-for-two-decades,2024-12-31,31,12,2024,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been in power at the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for over 20 years, ironically found itself complaining about illegal constructions in the city. Recently, Amit Shah, the MLA from Ellis Bridge, submitted a written complaint to the Mayor of Ahmedabad, Pratibha Jain, about illegal construction on an AMC plot in Jamalpur. According to Shah, the plot in question is located along the Rath Yatra route, from Jamalpur to Khamasa Road. The municipal plot (Survey No. 1880) is owned by AMC, and a private owner of the nearby plot (Survey No. 1881) has reportedly constructed a seven-story building on the AMC’s land without permission. Shah has demanded an investigation to determine whether the construction is illegal and, if so, action should be taken for land grabbing and the illegal construction should be demolished. In response, the Deputy Municipal Commissioner in charge of the central zone, Ramya Bhatt, confirmed that the plot is indeed owned by the AMC but assured that an investigation would be conducted to determine whether the construction is illegal. Despite being in power for two decades and holding such a significant position, Shah still finds himself having to bring complaints about illegal constructions to the Mayor, who is also from the ruling party. This situation indicates that there is little to no control over municipal officials, and the administration seems to be turning a blind eye to illegal constructions, even on their own plots.

Senior citizens targeted in gold theft spree during auto-rickshaw rides in Ahmedabad,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/senior-citizens-targeted-in-gold-theft-spree-during-auto-rickshaw-rides-in-ahmedabad,2024-12-31,31,12,2024,"A series of thefts targeting senior citizens during auto-rickshaw rides has raised serious safety concerns across Ahmedabad. Three separate incidents involving the theft of gold jewellery have been reported in recent weeks, prompting police investigations and calls for increased vigilance. Incident 1: Theft During an Overcrowded Ride A 62-year-old woman, Kiranben Ashwinbhai Limbachia, filed a complaint at Naranpura Police Station after her gold bangle, weighing 16.31 grams and valued at approximately ₹1 lakh, was stolen on November 27, 2024. Kiranben was travelling in an overcrowded auto-rickshaw from Ankur Crossroads to Pallava Crossroads for a physiotherapy session when her 22-carat gold bangle was surreptitiously removed from her wrist. She discovered the loss only after returning home and conducted a thorough search before reporting the theft. Authorities are currently reviewing CCTV footage from the area and investigating the co-passengers who were present in the rickshaw at the time. Incident 2: Sentimental Loss for a Retired Teacher In another case, Hansaben Chimanlal Upadhyay, a 73-year-old retired teacher, reported the theft of her gold bangle, valued at approximately ₹60,000, to the Vasana Police Station. The theft occurred on November 5, 2024, during an auto-rickshaw ride back home from the Omkaleshwar Mahadev Temple. Hansaben boarded a rickshaw near Patel School, which already had three passengers—a woman and two men. Upon reaching her residential society, she realized her bangle was missing. Due to the absence of a purchase receipt and personal commitments, she delayed filing the complaint until December 30, 2024. Vasana Police are examining CCTV footage and investigating the suspects. Incident 3: Theft Near Gujarat Vidyapith The third incident involved Hansaben Ishwarbhai Patel, a resident of Jaideep Society, who lost her gold bangle weighing 7 grams and valued at approximately ₹75,000 during a shared auto-rickshaw ride on November 29, 2024. The theft occurred near the Gujarat Vidyapith gate at Income Tax Four Roads. Hansaben reported that the rickshaw driver briefly asked her to alight due to overcrowding. Upon resuming her journey, she discovered her bangle was missing and suspects the involvement of the driver and fellow passengers. Vadaj Police suspect the work of an organized gang targeting shared transport users and are investigating the incident. Rising Safety Concerns These incidents highlight the vulnerability of senior citizens, especially those who rely on public transport. In response, the police have issued the following safety recommendations: - Avoid wearing expensive jewellery while commuting. - Exercise caution when travelling in overcrowded vehicles. - Report thefts promptly to facilitate swift investigations. Senior citizens and their families are urged to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions to prevent similar incidents.",ahmedabad

In Ahmedabad, many families are engaged in kite-making for nine months of the year, with work halting only during the four months of monsoon. This cottage industry provides livelihoods to numerous families across Ahmedabad throughout the year. Every year, around 1.5 lakh artisans from northern India travel to Ahmedabad and Surat to make kites. Gujarat manufactures kites worth ₹650 crores, contributing to 95% of India's kite market, with Ahmedabad and Surat leading the production. As winter approaches, kites start to fill the skies, peaking on January 14 and 15 during Uttarayan and Vasi Uttarayan, coupled with scrumptious Gujarati recipes including chikkis, and undhiyu. Kite markets seem bustling in Gujarat a month before Uttarayan; however, preparations for meeting this demand began six months earlier. In areas like Jamalpur, Kalupur, Dariyapur, Raikhad, Gheekanta, Narol, Vatva, Jamalpur, Ramol, Odhav, Isanpur, Gomtipur, Bapunagar, and Amraiwadi, a large number of Muslim artisans from other cities come to Ahmedabad to make kites. These artisans primarily hail from cities like Jaipur, Raebareli, Meerut, Ghaziabad, and Indore. Kites are made from materials like butter paper, tissue paper, local and polyester plastic paper, bamboo sticks, and string. Nowadays, kites are also customised with 3D printing. They are no longer limited to local markets; they have found a place in corporate gifting as well. Companies often present customised kites and spools as gifts to their employees. In Ahmedabad, kites are available for prices ranging from ₹2,000 to ₹1,000 or even ₹5,000, depending on their size, paper, and materials used. Kites from Ahmedabad are exported to countries like the United States, Canada, and Central Asia. Notably, kites were originally invented in China and later introduced to Delhi and northern Indian cities by the Mughals as a popular winter pastime. Today, Gujarat stands as the largest producer of kites in India, with the majority of artisans working in Ahmedabad and Surat. Due to the Gujaratis' passion for kites, the state leads the world in kite production. Also read: Chinese manja claims life of Narol man a month before Uttarayan",ahmedabad

The incident took place at Kanakpura Jewellers on Gymkhana Road around 3.45 pm on Tuesday. The robbers held shop owner Bharat Soni and his staff at gunpoint before fleeing with the loot. The robbers entered the shop wearing helmets with their faces covered to avoid identification. CCTV footage reveals the heist lasted only 7 to 8 minutes, during which the culprits made away with nearly 20 to 30 per cent of the displayed gold and silver ornaments. They then fled the scene on two-wheelers. CCTV grabs however have captured one of the suspects who was holding the helmet in his hand and walking outside and keeping a watch over the proceedings. 7 kg of gold secured Fortunately for the shop owner, approximately 7 kilograms of gold was securely locked in a drawer beneath the display items, escaping the robbers' attention and preventing even greater losses. Police investigations suggest the robbers strategically parked their two-wheelers at a construction site a few blocks away to facilitate their escape. Officials have since retrieved crucial evidence, including a helmet left behind at the site, and have identified the number plates of the getaway vehicles, which are now being traced. Four teams to nab accused Ahmedabad Rural SP Om Prakash Jat has confirmed the formation of four specialised teams to apprehend the culprits. These teams are employing CCTV footage, sniffer dogs, and human intelligence to follow leads. ""Our team has managed to identify the vehicles used in the crime, and we are closing in on the suspects,"" said SP Jat. ""The robbers appeared to have planned the heist meticulously, but with the evidence we have gathered, we are confident of capturing them soon."" The robbery carried out in broad daylight on a busy public road, has sparked widespread alarm among residents and business owners in South Bopal, a rapidly developing area. Many have called for increased police patrolling and stricter security measures to prevent such incidents in the future. Jewellery store owner Bharat Soni shared his distress, ""We were terrified as they pointed guns at us. Losing such a significant amount of jewellery is devastating, but the fact that it happened in broad daylight is even more troubling."" As investigations continue, the public eagerly awaits the resolution of the case, hoping for swift action to restore their confidence in law enforcement and safety in the area.",ahmedabad

Ahmedabad schools served GST notices worth ₹15 crore,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-schools-served-gst-notices-worth-15-crore,2025-01-03,3,01,2025,"The Goods & Service Tax Department (GST) has issued notices to top international schools and private universities in Ahmedabad to pay a total of ₹15 crore under the Reverse Charge Mechanism. Reverse Charge means the liability to pay tax is on the recipient of the services instead of the supplier. Each educational institute has been served a notice for a different amount, which totals around ₹15 crore, said the department sources. Some have paid the taxes after the notice, while some claim that they were not aware of such a tax. Sources suggest that international schools have tie-ups with schools abroad where they collaborate with international faculties to offer lectures at the schools. Apart from this, they also conduct workshops and seminars from the faculties abroad. Transactions involving these, including the amount paid to the foreign schools and faculties, are subjected to taxes. Sources in the department say that administrators may say that they are not aware of the tax, but in most cases, they form a private company and allot the contracts for workshops, seminars, and lectures to avoid these taxes. If an international school or a private university opens its own company and takes the service itself, it gets relief from tax and they do not even have to file a return in GST. If a university or international school files a return in GST, a lot of technical information also has to be provided, so such companies are formed to avoid both the tax and the hassle that comes with filing for the tax.",ahmedabad

However, by the end of December, projects worth only ₹3,300 crore have been completed. A budget of ₹950 crore was allocated for the development of all seven zones of the city. But, only ₹171.88 crore had been spent by the end of November. This highlights that basic facility works at the zone level have not been carried out as expected. With about three months remaining in the financial year, it remains uncertain whether the remaining 40% of the work can be completed. In 2023-24, an expenditure of ₹9,508 crore was incurred against a revenue income of ₹7,038 crore. Despite this, a revenue surplus of ₹876 crore was recorded as of March 31, 2024. This surplus was primarily due to the sale of various plots of land by the AMC and additional income generated due to GRUDA (Gujarat Regularisation of Unauthorised Development Act) impact fees. Notably, the municipal commissioner had estimated that ₹7,650 crore would be deposited as revenue income in the draft budget this year. However, by the end of November, only ₹4,609 crore had been deposited in the municipal treasury, leaving a shortfall of around ₹3,000 crore.

For the first time since the inception of the flower show in 2013, the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has hired a design team for better aesthetics and display of the Flower Show.

AMC Commissioner M Thennarasan, and Deputy Commissioner Dev Chowdhary hired AVN Architecture and Urbanism’s team Rashi Khode, Jagdish Gorle, Manish Kumar, and Jaimin Dalsania led by founders Hitesh Chhadva, and Purvi Bhatt in October 2024. The team has used 10,08,900 tray plants, 10,08,796 bag plants, and 59,150 potted plants in the Flower Show. “We have used 100 types of flowers to design the structures but mostly seasonal flowers, so that they can resist the winter atmosphere. However, we replace cut flowers at every 3 to 4 days interval and fresh flowers every 7 the to 8 days interval,” said Purvi Bhatt from the design team. “The whole Flower Show is the collective efforts of AMC's Garden Department's A C Patel, Asifbhai and Dilip Patel, Abdul Mal from the electrical team and the six teams of workers,” said Bhatt. What is new this time? The design team that was hired by AMC, made sure that the show was interactive and experiential. “We have added concepts of flower valleys, flower canyons, flower waterfalls, animals, and temples inspired by the geographical landscapes, culture, and flora and fauna of India,” said Bhatt. An audio guide scanner has been placed near the flower structures to listen to descriptions of the structures in three languages: English, Hindi, and Gujarati.

The victim, 36-year-old Leelaram Chaudhary, filed a complaint with the Sabarmati Police after an unknown individual stole his mobile phone and ATM cards, subsequently using them for unauthorised transactions. The incident occurred on December 30, 2024, while Chaudhary was travelling from Manpur Railway Station to Sabarmati Railway Station. Chaudhary had hired a shared auto-rickshaw for ₹200 to reach the Sabarmati station. The auto already had three occupants – the driver and two men aged between 25 and 30. Upon arriving at the railway station around 6.30 pm, Leelaram discovered that his OnePlus mobile phone and two ATM cards one from Kotak Mahindra Bank and the other from the State Bank of India (SBI) were missing. Despite searching thoroughly, he was unable to locate the items. The following day, Leelaram checked his bank statements and was shocked to find a series of unauthorised transactions. His Kotak Mahindra Bank account had been drained of ₹2.02 lakh through ATM withdrawals and purchases at jewellery shops, including ₹1.27 lakh spent at Vaibhav Lakshmi Jewellers. Similarly, ₹87,300 was withdrawn from his SBI account. Leelaram admitted that the PIN codes for both ATM cards had been written inside his mobile phone cover, which likely enabled the thieves to carry out the fraudulent transactions with ease. A senior police official confirmed that a case had been registered at the Sabarmati Police Station and that an investigation was underway. “The team has started tracing the auto-rickshaw involved in the crime.

Justice Moksha K Thakkar of the high court dismissed the writ petition of the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) challenging the order of the Labour Court regarding payment of leave encashment to retired employees. The court further said that the claim of the retired employees of AMC is based on the certificate issued by the corporation itself and therefore it cannot be said that the Labour Court has erred in awarding in favour of the retired employees. “Depriving a person of leave encashment without a valid statutory provision is a violation of the constitutional provision,” said the court. If an employee has availed a leave and the employee has opted to have his accrued leave credited, the cash amount becomes his right and in the absence of any authority, that right cannot be violated by the petitioner. The Labour Court had ordered the AMC to pay the retired employee of the AMC in cash amount of ₹1,63,620. The court also imposed a fine of ₹1,000 on the AMC. AMC had then filed a writ petition in the Gujarat High Court. Opposing the petition on behalf of the respondent employee, it was stated that leave encashment is a right of the employee and the authorities are bound to pay the leave in cash.

A two-month-old baby at a private hospital in Chandkheda is believed to be positive with HMPV, as per reports. However, there has been no official confirmation yet. Earlier in the day, the ICMR – Indian Council of Medical Research – confirmed two cases of HMPV in a Karnataka hospital. Two infants, one three-month-old female and eight-month-old were tested positive for the virus, that is believed to have overwhelmed health facilities in China. What is HMPV? HMPV, discovered in 2001, comes in the Pneumoviridae family along with the Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, serological studies have shown that it has existed in humans for more than 60 years and is distributed all over the world. The virus can lead to upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are majorly affected. It has an incubation period of between three to five days. Wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, and increasing immunity can help prevent the disease. Experts are also warning against using antivirals for HMPV. In a recent interview with the state-backed National Business Daily, a respiratory expert at a Shanghai hospital warned the public against blindly using antiviral drugs to fight human metapneumovirus, for which there is no vaccine but whose symptoms resemble those of a cold. HMPV had in 2023 been detected in the Netherlands, Britain, Finland, Australia, Canada, the US and China. The reports claim that the spike in HMPV cases has led to an alarming increase in sudden deaths, with people aged 40 to 80 being particularly affected. “China is facing a surge in multiple viruses, including Influenza A, HMPV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Covid-19, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums.

"Nothing ‘VIP’ at Ahmedabad Flower Show: 7x prices, no extra facilities",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/nothing-vip-at-ahmedabad-flower-show-7x-prices-no-extra-facilities,2025-01-08,8,01,2025,"The Ahmedabad Flower Show has welcomed more than 1.62 lakh visitors from  January 3 to 7. The initiative of Amdavad Municipal Corporation has garnered significant attention, both for its overwhelming success and for the growing debate surrounding its premium ticketing. While the event has been widely praised for attracting crowds, it has also faced criticism regarding the high cost of VIP tickets and the lack of exclusive benefits for premium slot holders. Despite the high attendance, the introduction of the VIP culture has stirred debate. According to officials, the VIP slots, introduced for the first time after 10 years, were designed to provide a peaceful and crowd-free experience, particularly during the 8 am to 9 am and 10 pm to 11 pm time slots. These slots, marketed as a solution for those who wish to enjoy the show in quieter conditions, are significantly more expensive than regular tickets—5 to 7 times the cost of the normal tickets. However, many visitors have raised concerns about the fairness of such pricing, especially when no additional exclusive benefits, such as VIP access to certain areas or special services, are offered to those holding premium tickets. Visitors have questioned why they should pay such a high price for a less crowded experience when the rest of the flower show remains accessible to regular ticket holders without any major differences in what is being offered. The regular tickets, priced at ₹70 on weekdays and ₹100 on weekends, remain relatively affordable compared to the ₹500 premium tickets. Yet, for many, the real draw of the show lies in the morning and evening prime time slots, which offer cooler temperatures and a more tranquil experience. Moreover, if you are a regular ticket holder, at 9.15 pm, you would be asked to move out, even if your ticket was paid at 8.55 pm, to make way for the ‘VIPs’. As of January 7, the show saw a total of 162,087 visitors. The highest number of attendees was recorded on Sunday, January 5, with a staggering 70,033 people visiting the flower show. Among these, 2,027 premium tickets priced at ₹500 each were sold, with the highest number of premium slots being sold on Saturday, January 4, when 843 tickets were purchased for both the morning and evening prime time slots. However, these prime slots are seen as a luxury, accessible only to those willing to pay the steep ticket prices. The 8 am to 9 am time slot, known for its fresh dew and peaceful atmosphere, is a popular choice for early risers, especially office-goers who want to visit before the working day begins. The 10 pm to 11 pm slot, which runs after regular ticket holders have left for the day, similarly offers a quieter experience but lacks any exclusive amenities for premium ticket holders. Moreover, visitors who enter the show just around 8.45 pm—are often forced to leave by 9.20 pm, limiting the amount of time they can spend enjoying the show. At 9.15 pm an evacuation announcement is made which also adds to the chaos, as large groups of visitors exit the show at once, contributing to the congestion on nearby roads. While the flower show continues to draw large crowds, the influx of visitors has also led to significant traffic congestion, particularly around the western end of the riverfront, where the flower show is located. Auto-rickshaw drivers waiting for passengers in the area further exacerbate the situation, causing delays for both show visitors and regular commuters.",ahmedabad
"Fire breaks out at Himalaya Mall, no casualties reported",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/fire-breaks-out-at-himalaya-mall-no-casualties-reported,2025-01-08,8,01,2025,"A fire broke out on Wednesday afternoon in an interior designing office located on the fourth floor of the Himalaya Mall on Drive-In Road, Ahmedabad. Swift action by the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services ensured that no casualties were reported in the incident. Incident details According to fire officials, the fire began at around 3.45 pm in the office’s outer air conditioning (AC) panel and quickly spread indoors. Upon noticing the fire, the office staff was immediately evacuated, and neighbouring offices were alerted. Approximately 200 to 300 people were inside the mall at the time, causing a brief panic. However, mall security and maintenance staff managed to guide visitors to safety. Six fire tenders, staffed by 25 firefighters, were dispatched to the scene to contain the fire. In the meantime, the mall’s security team attempted to control the flames using fire extinguishers and water hoses. Their efforts helped to limit the spread of the fire until the fire brigade arrived. Fire contained after three hours After three hours of continuous efforts, the firefighters managed to extinguish the flames and initiated a cooling process to prevent re-ignition. Divisional Fire Officer Om Jadeja stated, “Preliminary investigations indicate that the fire originated in the outer panel of the AC dock due to overloading and overheating of the electrical supply. This led to the fire spreading inside the office.” The authorities have since called in experts to investigate the matter further. A team from Torrent Power also inspected the site to assess potential electrical faults. Causes of overheating Overheating, often a precursor to such incidents, occurs when components or devices are subjected to temperatures beyond their design limits. Common causes include: - Faulty wiring or loose connections leading to excessive resistance. - Malfunctioning equipment, such as motors or transformers. - Short circuits generating heat at fault points. - Insulation breakdown, making materials more susceptible to fire.",ahmedabad

The accused, identified as Vikramsingh alias Virendrasingh Rathore, a native of Khambha village in Amreli district, lured victims by promising them housing at prime locations in the city. The incident The complaint, filed by Pradeepkumar Kumawat of Vejalpur, detailed how the accused orchestrated the scam. Rathore introduced himself as an official at the Gandhinagar secretariat's Housing department and claimed to be responsible for house allotments at Science City Road, Sola. He reportedly gained the victims’ trust by fabricating documents, including Aadhaar and PAN card submissions, and handing over fake property index numbers. The complainant, along with his family and acquaintances, handed over a total of ₹20 lakh to Rathore in multiple instalments. This included ₹4 lakh each from the complainant and four others—Mukesh Singh, Mancharam Mewada, Pushpa Mewada, and Nifita Prajapati. Initially, Rathore provided a copy of a property index in the complainant’s wife's name, claiming that the remaining documents would be couriered. However, upon visiting the Mamlatdar office in Gota for verification, the victims were repeatedly misled with excuses such as server downtime. Eventually, they discovered that the documents were fake, and Rathore was not a government official. Pattern of deception Rathore’s modus operandi involved identifying himself as a government official, convincing victims to pay an advance for housing schemes, and later evading them by refusing calls or meetings. The victims realised the fraud when they received no tangible results despite repeated follow-ups. Police complaint The victims lodged a formal complaint with the Anandnagar police on January 7. The complaint accuses Rathore of criminal impersonation, cheating, and forgery under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The accused is reportedly still at large. The Anandnagar police have initiated an investigation, with senior officers assuring that stringent action will be taken against Rathore and any accomplices involved.

According to the guidelines of the Ayushman Bharat scheme, payments for treatments should be made within 41 days of the service being provided. However, many states, including Madhya Pradesh, have not adhered to this deadline, leading to delayed payments and mounting debts for hospitals.

Prajapati was arrested by the CID Crime Branch and presented in court. During the hearing, prosecutor Pravin Trivedi informed the court that in the BZ scam, 11,232 people have been defrauded of ₹422.96 crore. The accounts of the BZ scam were managed by Prajapati, and for this reason, he needs to be questioned, the prosecutor argued. The BZ firm operated 16 branches in different locations, and Prajapati was working at the Ranasan branch, where he handled the firm's accounts. It was also found that ₹92.89 lakh were transferred from the BZ account into Prajapati’s personal account. To investigate where he used this money and what assets he acquired with it, the prosecutor argued that the remand was necessary. Additionally, since Prajapati was handling the accounts for the BZ scam, questions were raised about the audit of the firm, as well as the whereabouts of client forms and related documents. To further question him on these matters, the prosecutor sought the remand of the accused in the BZ scam. The rural court granted the remand of the accused for three days.

Bopal robbery case accused nabbed from Uttar Pradesh,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/bopal-robbery-case-accused-nabbed-from-uttar-pradesh,2025-01-13,13,01,2025,"Ahmedabad Rural Police have detained four suspects in connection with the ₹73 lakh daylight robbery at Kanakpura Jewellers in Bopal. The incident, which occurred on January 2 around 3.45 pm on Gymkhana Road, saw robbers hold shop owner Bharat Soni and his staff at gunpoint before fleeing with a significant haul of gold and silver ornaments. Arrests in Uttar Pradesh The police investigation revealed that the accused fled to Uttar Pradesh immediately after the robbery. A tracking operation pinpointed their locations: two suspects were hiding in Aligarh, one in Ghaziabad, and the fourth in Firozabad. Acting on this intelligence, police teams were dispatched to the respective cities, resulting in the detention of all four suspects. Superintendent of Ahmedabad Rural Police Om Prakash Jat confirmed the development, ""We have detained four individuals in connection with the case. They are being brought to Ahmedabad for interrogation. Further details will be disclosed following their questioning."" Profiles of the accused Initial inquiries revealed that all four suspects are natives of Uttar Pradesh who had been residing in Ahmedabad for work. Two of them were employed as security guards, while another has a prior criminal record for theft. Details of the heist CCTV footage showed the robbers entering the shop with their faces covered and wearing helmets to avoid identification. The brazen heist lasted merely 7 to 8 minutes, during which they looted an estimated 20-30% of the displayed jewellery. The robbers fled on two-wheelers parked at a nearby construction site to evade capture. Interestingly, about 7 kilograms of gold, securely locked in a drawer beneath the display counter, escaped the robbers' notice, sparing the shop owner from even greater losses. Evidence and leads Key evidence recovered includes CCTV footage of the suspects and a helmet left behind at the escape site. The number plates of the getaway vehicles have also been identified and are being traced. Ahmedabad Rural SP Om Prakash Jat had formed four specialised teams to investigate the case. These teams are employing a combination of CCTV analysis, sniffer dogs, and human intelligence to build a solid case against the suspects.

Amdavadis consume 5 lakh kg of 'Undhiyu' during Uttarayan,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/lifestyle-fashion/amdavadis-devour-5-lakh-kg-of-undhiyu-during-uttarayan,2025-01-13,13,01,2025,"If Uttarayan is a time for fun and flying kites, can food be far behind. The kite festival is also a time to relish delicacies in Gujarat and what better than having Undhiyu, a traditional Gujarati dish of mixed vegetables, fenugreek dumplings, and spices, usually prepared in winter. If figures are anything to go by, Amdavadis consume around 5 lakh kg of Undhiyu on the festive day of Uttarayan, as per reports. This 2,000-year-old tradition of cooking Undhiyu in an earthen pot and burying it in the earth to let it cook with the heat from the ground has been passed down through generations. This recipe, now an Uttarayan special, dates back to the Maurya era and is considered more historic than the kite-flying festival itself. Today, Undhiyu is made on coal stoves or regular stoves at home, and it is a staple dish in almost every Amdavadi household during lunch on kite flying day. Around 3,000 makeshift shops in the city sell around 5,00,000 kg of Undhiyu on January 14. History of Undhiyu During the Maurya period (322-185 BCE) and from 320-550 CE in India, the festival of Makar Sankranti was celebrated locally, and at that time, all vegetables were steamed in clay pots with spices and consumed. However, during the 15th to 17th centuries, with the influx of various communities in Gujarat owing to trade, new elements were introduced to this tradition in different ways, which have evolved into what we now recognise as Undhiyu. After the 15th century, Surat gained prominence as a major trade centre due to its proximity to the coast. The variety of spices brought in through trade is believed to have contributed to the evolution of Surat’s unique version of Undhiyu.

The situation was further exacerbated by people out on Uttarayan shopping across the city. Commuters alleged that if the police had focused more on managing traffic instead of concentrating on confiscating and seizing Chinese threads, such traffic situations might have been avoided. On Sunday, the flower show and kite festival on the west side of the r iverfront , combined with retail shops on the r iverfront , caused significant traffic congestion on both the r iverfront and Ashram Road. As a result, many flower show visitors were stuck in traffic for long periods, and some even postponed their visit to another day. Additionally, the parking spaces on the West riverfront were all full. Moreover, areas like Delhi Darwaja, Khadia, Raipur, and Bapunagar’s kite market also experienced heavy traffic as people flocked to shop for kites. While traffic officials are usually seen around the kite market, they were reportedly a scarce sight on Sunday.

On Monday night, areas such as Delhi Chakla, Kalupur Tankshal, Raipur, Paldi, Maninagar, Satellite, and SG Highway in Ahmedabad saw crowds gather for last-minute purchases of kites and reels. Bird helpline numbers The festival often leads to injuries among animals and birds due to kite strings. Since 2015, the Gujarat government has undertaken the Karuna Abhiyan to rescue and treat injured birds and animals. Emergency helplines like 8320002000 (WhatsApp), 1926 (Forest Department), and 1962 (Animal Husbandry Department) have been set up to address such cases. Special teams at the Airport At Ahmedabad airport, a dedicated 10-member team has been formed to remove kites and strings from the runway during Uttarayan and Vasi Uttarayan. Loose kites and strings often obstruct aircraft during take-off and landing, occasionally getting caught in the wheels. Last year, over 15,000 kites were cleared from the airport’s runway during the festival. Bird fatalities In the last three years, more than 1,000 birds have died due to injuries from kite strings during Uttarayan. Over the past eight years, 95,000+ birds have been injured, and 7,584 have lost their lives. The festivities continue with immense joy, but efforts to minimize harm to the environment and wildlife are equally emphasised.

Special POCSO Judge J L Chowatia also criticised the police work in this case and again issued a non-bailable warrant against the accused. The special POCSO court, severely criticising the police, said that although the accused has been active on his Instagram ID for a long time and has been increasing his followers, the police have not been able to track him and produce him in court. The court ordered a report on the police’s efforts to arrest the accused within 30 days. Additional Public Prosecutor Bharat Patni, representing the state government, drew the attention of the court that in 2022, the accused teacher Ravirajsinh Chauhan of St Xavier’s School had sent obscene messages to innocent students of the school aged 13 to 14 years and had molested them. Later, a police complaint was registered against the teacher at the Gujarat University Police Station. Chauhan was also arrested earlier and was released on conditional bail, but the accused absconded once he was out on bail. The accused has completely violated and misused the bail granted by the court, therefore the court should adopt a strict stance and take punitive action, argued the prosecutor.

This comes despite the service being burdened with a debt of ₹4620.77 crore. Over the past two years, AMTS has been announcing plans for electric bus charging stations and parking facilities. Currently,  seven electric double-decker buses are operational across various city routes. The authorities claim to run 1,172 buses. However, according to sources, only 927 buses are on the road. The draft budget for 2025-26 includes a proposal to introduce 60 mini AC electric buses. AMTS has been under significant financial strain for over two decades due to loans from AMC. The service seems to prioritise operators running AMTS buses rather than city commuters. While the previous year's budget was ₹641.50 crore, this year’s allocation has increased by ₹40 crore. The proposed ₹682 crore budget allocates ₹348 crore solely for salaries, pensions, and establishment expenses. In 2024-25, AMC extended a loan of ₹410 crore to AMTS, and an additional ₹437 crore loan is planned for 2025-26. Despite the plans, AMTS’s revenue estimate for the year is only ₹238 crore. Notably, no AMTS-owned buses are currently operational. The draft budget claims that 1,113 buses, including 118 operation-and-maintenance and private operator buses, will run during the financial year, with seven electric double-decker buses continuing to serve. Key budget provisions: - Introduction of 225 new AC electric buses to replace expiring contracts of CNG buses. - Free travel passes for registered labourers under the Labour Welfare Board. - Revamped mobile app for daily ticketing. - Creation of a 100-bus charging and parking station at Jamalpur, and initiatives previously planned are reintroduced in this draft. The draft budget does not address the impact of vigilance checks on revenue. Senior citizens face challenges renewing their passes, and no significant measures have been taken to address these concerns. Loan and grants By December 2024, AMC had provided loans totaling ₹4620.77 crore to AMTS. Moreover, under the Chief Minister’s Urban Bus Transportation Scheme, AMTS is expected to receive ₹130 crore based on a maximum subsidy of ₹18 per kilometer and ₹15 crore from AUDA (Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority). Special provisions in the budget: 1. Increase in charter bus fares: - The fare for special charter buses has increased from ₹2,000 for two hours to ₹4,500 for three hours. Outside Ahmedabad, the fare for three hours is ₹7,500. Religious trips now cost ₹3,000 instead of ₹2,500, and ₹5,000 for outstation religious trips. 2. Development projects: - Multi-modal transport hub at RTO. - 60 AC electric buses (12 meters) to be acquired under GCC (Gross Cost Contract) model. - Construction of 800 smart shelters and 300 mini shelters using grants from MLAs, corporators, and MPs. - Refreshment counters at Lal Darwaja on PPP (Public-Private Partnership) model. - Integrated terminal at Ghuma with grants under the Swarnim Jayanti Mukhyamantri Urban Development Scheme. Despite these ambitious plans, significant challenges remain in operational efficiency, financial management, and customer satisfaction for AMTS.

Gujarat HC asks govt to introduce concrete plan on ‘Chinese manja issue’,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-hc-asks-govt-to-introduce-concrete-plan-on-chinese-manja-issue,2025-01-14,14,01,2025,"During the hearing of a writ petition  in Gujarat High Court on Monday, a division bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Pranav Trivedi told the Gujarat government that the issue of banned deadly kite strings or manja is a persistent problem. The state government was directed to come before the court with a concrete plan for its permanent solution. Throughout Gujarat, despite legal bans by the National Green Tribunal, Gujarat High Court, and police authorities on Chinese string, glass-coated nylon string, and Chinese tukkals , a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Gujarat High Court regarding their illegal production, sale, and use. From the government’s side, Chief Public Prosecutor Gursharan Singh Virk stated that in the last four days, 609 FIRs have been registered across the state and more than 612 people have been arrested. The advertisements and publicity informing about the ban on the thread (likely referring to Chinese manja or similar dangerous kite strings) were to be improved, and that has been done, according to Virk. People are being informed accordingly. Advocates Nimish Kapadia and Bhunesh Rupera, representing the petitioners, stated that it appears the government has taken effective action regarding the dangerous thread issue in the last four days, but it is necessary that this strict enforcement continues even during Uttarayan. The HC also made a remark that it is not appropriate that the hearing of this case takes place every year at the last minute, that is, only a few days before Uttarayan. Therefore, in order to ensure that the case can be heard systematically and a proper concrete result can be obtained, it would be appropriate to hear this case before the Uttarayan festival. Saying this, the high court scheduled a further hearing of the case in September 2025. Also read: Uttarayan is here, say no to illegal Chinese manja, keep animal helplines handy",ahmedabad
Kite festival is booming biz with ₹1 lakh rent-a-terrace in Ahmedabad’s walled city,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/1-lakh-per-terrace-uttarayan-terrace-on-rent-becomes-booming-business-in-ahmedabad,2025-01-14,14,01,2025,"Come Uttarayan, and it is business as usual for the pols in the walled city of Ahmedabad. January 14 and 15, the festival of Uttarayan and Vasi Uttarayan, sets the stage for cultural tourism, as pol residents rent out their terraces for visitors to dive into Gujarat’s world-famous kite festival up close and personal. More than ‘terrace-on-rent’ In a trend that has caught up in recent years, the locals host people from across Gujarat, India, and even from around the world. However, what started as a simple ‘terrace on rent’, has now taken the shape of a full-fledged hosting venture that could compete with any five-star host or vacation rental company. “In Gujarati, we say Haath halavta aavo (come bringing nothing),” said Ketan Vyas, who hosts Uttarayan tourists in Dariyapur’s Vadigam. “We offer food, water, snacks, manja (threads), and kites – from morning to evening – it’s all on us.” “If we serve them right, they would like to come back next year,” Vyas notes. Booming business This, however, comes with a price. Vyas, who hosts three such properties, can easily accommodate 40 to 50 people in a day. With his prices set at ₹4,000 per person, a group of 10 people would easily be lighter by ₹40,000. If the group is interested in the ‘package’ of two days, Vyas offers a 50% discount on the second day. For NRIs and foreigners, he has a quotation in dollars, which reads $92 (~₹7,900) per person. Corporates are also known to approach such hosts. If a team of 15-20 employees find themselves in the middle of the city having the time of their lives, the hosts have the opportunity to earn ₹80,000 to ₹1,00,000. Byproduct hive-offs “The food comes from outside vendors, who set up shops in Raipur in Uttarayan,” said another host, Chetana Soni of Raipur, adding, “The undhiyu and Jjalebi, Uttarayan staples, we order for our guests from the special shops put up for the day.” Soni emphasised that it is not only the people of pols who are earning and introducing outsiders to the ‘Uttarayan of the pols’, but many small players benefit from this economy. “The shops outside, kite and manja shops, the lodges and hotels near the walled city, all get to earn from this,” said Soni. What’s next? Already this year, the corporatisation process has begun. What started as single players renting out the terrace, is now seeing the first glimpses of a middle-management by tour and travel companies. The bigger firms are getting the homeowners in touch with potential clients, and the days of commercialisation seem close. One of the hosts that Gujarat Samachar Digital visited, had found their clients through an advertisement from the bigger tour and travel agency, who offers its clients the experience of Uttarayan in Ahmedabad. It remains  to be seen if the cultural tourism unique to Ahmedabad would now find a system structure that would help all the parties involved, or the rustic charm of being hosted by a family fades away as in business lingo as the process becomes more mainstream by the day. Like flying a kite, the balance between economy and culture of Uttarayan hangs by on a thin thread, it’s fate depending on the hand that lets go, or ‘pulls the string’.",ahmedabad
"Uttarayan is here, say no to illegal Chinese manja, keep animal helplines handy",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/uttarayan-is-here-say-no-to-illegal-chinese-manja-keep-animal-helplines-handy,2025-01-14,14,01,2025,"Makar Sankranti or Uttarayan (Kite festival) is around the corner, and the Ahmedabad sky will be full of kites of various hues. However, amid the festive vibes it is imperative that we don’t lose our humanity. Animal protection organisation, Humane Society International/India (HSI/India) has urged citizens across India to celebrate a cruelty-free Makar Sankranti by refraining from the use of synthetic or ‘Chinese manja ’ to fly kites. Chinese manja is the term used for strings coated with crushed glass that are dangerously sharp and have been known to cut through the skin of birds, animals, and humans – causing fatal injuries. Every year, thousands of birds suffer from injuries, some fatal, due to entanglement in these hazardous strings. As per data shared by Jivdaya Charitable Trust, an Ahmedabad NGO, approximately 4,000 birds were injured in Ahmedabad in 2024. The dangers of synthetic manja extend to humans as well, causing injuries to motorcyclists and children. According to last year’s data, 54 people were injured in two days of Uttarayan in Ahmedabad, and at least six were killed in Gujarat due to manja cuts. Festival woes Despite the National Green Tribunal’s ban on the use of Chinese manja in 2017, the sale and use of this hazardous material persists across India. Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita 2023 makes the use of Chinese manja a punishable offence with a fine of ₹5,000 or imprisonment up to one year Alokparna Sengupta, managing director, HSI/India said: “This disregard for the law is troubling as it turns a joyous occasion into a death trap for birds, animals and humans.” “Not only does this jeopardize public safety and animal welfare, but it highlights the urgent need for authorities to enforce stricter measures. At the same time, we urge the citizens to celebrate a compassionate Makar Sankranti . When you are out shopping for this sankranti , please buy cotton threads to fly your kite. Do not pay for something which is not only illegal but also cruel and can injure and kill those around you,” he added. Call for action Use eco-friendly manja : Traditional cotton threads, once commonly used for kite flying, are safe for both humans and animals and do not contribute to environmental damage. Report the illegal sale of Chinese manja : If you come across any vendors selling it, inform the local police authorities immediately. Keep a list of bird helplines handy: If you come across an injured bird, immediately contact the nearest helpline in your area. Helpline numbers for birds/animals: ‘1962’ (Karuna Helpline) or any local NGO if you see any injured bird or animal. Sajag Group: 7878171727 Jivaya Charitable Trust: 9924418184 Be mindful of waste: Dispose of kite strings and materials responsibly, avoiding littering in public spaces, roads and water bodies.

The incident occurred on January 13, between 10.45 am and 4.30 pm, when Bhavsar was strangled, and his gold ornaments, cash, mobile phones, and other valuables stolen. Bhavsar, who held Canadian permanent residency, frequently visited Ahmedabad. He had two children settled in Canada, making his trips to the city a routine occurrence. Following the discovery of Bhavsar’s body by his wife, Varshaben (67), the police were alerted. Initially registered as an accidental death, the case escalated after the post-mortem report confirmed strangulation as the cause of death. An FIR was subsequently lodged at the Vastrapur police station under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. Swift police action Recognising the gravity of the crime, the Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad city, instructed a joint team led by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone-1) Balaram Meena, Local Crime Branch officials, and officers from the Vastrapur police station.

The police recovered stolen items worth ₹3.7 lakh, including three Apple mobile phones, four wristwatches (Rado, Casio, and Lobor brands), Cash. The criminal plot The investigation revealed that Heena, originally from Mumbai, had moved to Ahmedabad a few years ago to work at a spa, where she met Anand, a frequent visitor. They eventually married, with Heena continuing spa services privately, while Anand worked as an auto driver. Heena first came into contact with Bhavsar around 18 months ago, visiting his residence 14 to 15 times whenever he visite Ahmedabad. Knowing Bhavsar’s NRI status and his possession of valuables, the couple planned to rob him. Their plan involved Heena rendering Bhavsar unconscious during her visit, allowing Anand to enter the flat unnoticed and steal the valuables.

Officials are now working with bank representatives to trace the flow of funds from Dr Lakhtariya’s accounts and identify recipients of the misappropriated money. The investigation focuses on unauthorised payments to knowledge partners and fund transfers to accounts linked to the accused. Authorities are also probing the possible involvement of others in this financial mismanagement case. In a major revelation, Dr Kamaljit I Lakhtariya, associate professor and former coordinator of the Animation Department at Gujarat University, was accused of embezzling funds amounting to over ₹1.15 crore. The alleged financial irregularities came to light following an internal audit and investigation into the department's financial transactions. Allegations of fraud The allegations state that between 2021 and 2023, Dr Lakhtariya misappropriated funds from the Animation Department's Kotak Mahindra Bank account, transferring significant amounts to his personal and relatives' accounts. This included ₹ 1.15 crore directly misappropriated, causing substantial financial losses to Gujarat University. The investigation, initiated after discrepancies were flagged by the university's accounts department in 2023, revealed unauthorised payments to knowledge partners, additional expenses exceeding approved limits, and misuse of funds meant for university operations. Audit findings A report prepared by chartered accountant Ronak D Shah, commissioned by the university, outlined multiple financial discrepancies: Fees and payments amounting to ₹1.14 crore were made without approval. Additional payments to knowledge partners, not specified in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), cost the university over ₹24 lakh. Expenditures incurred under Dr Lakhtariya’s tenure lacked supporting documents or proper authorisation. The report further indicated that the funds were utilised for personal gain, including transfers to accounts linked to Dr Lakhtariya and his relatives. University action Following the findings, the university’s executive council convened on April 14, 2024, deciding to relieve Dr Lakhtariya of his duties. However, it was noted that he failed to hand over official records and files, further complicating the investigation. The council has also directed legal proceedings against Dr Lakhtariya under charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust, and financial fraud. Police investigation On Friday, the Ahmedabad Crime Branch registered a case and began an investigation under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. Dr Lakhtariya served as the coordinator of the Animation Department since 2013. Ahmedabad Crime Branch Inspector D B Patel has confirmed the arrest of Kamaljit Lakhtariya following an FIR filed by Gujarat University. Lakhtariya, accused of financial misconduct in the university's Animation Department, was presented in court and taken into remand for further investigation. “The investigation will focus on understanding why Lakhtariya authorised payments to the department’s knowledge partners exceeding the agreed amounts, and why Gujarat University received less than the stipulated funds,” Patel further stated Authorities will probe whether these discrepancies were carried out under instructions from others and whether additional individuals were involved in the multi-crore financial irregularities. Further inquiries will also examine the misuse of departmental funds allegedly transferred to the accounts of Lakhtariya’s associates. The transactions in these accounts are under scrutiny as part of the ongoing investigation into this high-profile embezzlement case.",ahmedabad

The unfortunate ruckus occurred when the Bench of Chief Justice Agarwal and Justice Pranav Trivedi were hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) related to the issue of illegal constructions on Friday. As per the video streaming, Trivedi started speaking in a loud voice with Chief Justice Agarwal. During the hearing, Agarwal requested calmly, “Mr Counsel, please let me complete. I was making some statements. I was asking you something, but you did not allow me to complete my question,” “This is not the way a court should decide a pending matter, please allow me to complete my sentence, and understand the question. It was my mistake to have understood the question beforehand and I am sorry for that,” apologised the bar president, but in a resentful voice. Listening to Trivedi’s heated behaviour, Chief Justice was seen looking to the roof and seemed to have pondered on some thoughts, while Trivedi again burst. “This is how your ladyship wants to listen without even permitting the advocates to speak, that is enough, your ladyship may leave the matter, place it before another appropriate bench. This is not how your ladyship should behave, looking somewhere else. My request is to release the matter,” Trivedi said. “Ladyship is looking at the sky, this has not happened in this court in 65 years,” he added. Meanwhile, Agarwal requested Trivedi “to not create a scene” and not to raise a finger to the court. To which Trivedi said that ‘it is the other way around’. While it seemed that Trivedi was storming out of the courtroom, he came back to accuse the chief justice of being an “overspeaking judge” whom every senior lawyer has been “tolerating”. “Every senior advocate, advocate of the Court, has been very kind enough to tolerate this. I had in the 2023 year used a nice quotation of Lord Francis Bacon. I don’t want to repeat it. I hope your ladyship remembers that... I am not a judge, it is about an overspeaking judge,” he said. The aforementioned quote refers to Lord Francis Bacon’s book ‘The Essays or Counsels, Civill and Morall; of Judicature’, in which he proposed “patience and gravity of hearing is an essential part of justice; and an overspeaking judge is no well-tuned cymbal”.",ahmedabad

The project, undertaken in collaboration with the Railway Land Development Authority, will cost ₹440 crore, with the state government contributing 50% under the Swarnim Jayanti Mukhyamantri Urban Development Scheme. Additionally,  ₹53 crore has been allocated for a new bridge at the crossing on the Radhanpur-Bhilot road. “The redevelopment aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Virasat Bhi, Vikas Bhi’, prioritizing citizens ease of living. The Kalupur railway overbridge, constructed in 1915, and the Sarangpur overbridge, built in 1940, will be expanded into four-lane structures,” officials shared. Currently, the Kalupur overbridge, known as Manu Bhai Parmar Bridge, has three lanes with footpaths, while the Sarangpur overbridge features two lanes. These upgrades aim to enhance safety and extend the lifespan of both bridges. Chief Minister Patel said that the “funding demonstrates the government’s commitment to modernizing infrastructure and addressing the city's growing needs.” Kalupur Railway Station, officially known as Ahmedabad Junction (ADI), was established in 1866 during British rule as part of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway (BB&CI) network. Located near the city centre, it played a vital role in connecting Ahmedabad to major cities across India and supporting the region’s booming textile industry by facilitating the transport of goods like cotton and textiles. The station, known for its blend of colonial and traditional architecture, has evolved through phases of modernisation, including platform expansions, electrification, and advanced ticketing systems. Currently, with 12 platforms, it is one of Gujarat’s busiest railway hubs and a key player in the state’s economic growth. It currently accommodates approximately 1.2 lakh passengers daily. However, estimates of daily footfall vary, with some reports indicating figures as high as 2.8 lakh passengers per day.

This marks a staggering 3.5-fold increase from ₹4,475 crore in 2021. The surge is fuelled by widespread enthusiasm for stock trading, faster investor registration processes (e-KYC), and the ease of internet and mobile app trading. In October 2024, Ahmedabad alone achieved an impressive daily turnover of ₹19,408 crore, compared to ₹3,655 crore in October 2021, marking a 4.3-fold increase.

Reports indicate that the concert is expected to attract 2,00,383 attendees over the course of two days. When Coldplay tickets were first released, amidst all the excitement, fans across the country rushed to book their spots. However, the euphoria has now many local residents and visitors from Mumbai are now eager to relinquish their tickets for various reasons. Pratham Modhiya, an MBA student in a conversation with Gujarat Samachar Digital said, “I received a Coldplay ticket for free from a friend who no longer wants to attend after seeing numerous posts on social media. I am more interested in ‘Satsangs’ and don’t plan to go to the concert either. While I have the ticket, I have decided not to attend.” Additionally, several fans who missed out on tickets for the Mumbai concert had planned to travel to Ahmedabad for the event. However, they are now reconsidering due to high airfare and a lack of accommodation options in the city. Urvashi Patel, a fan looking forward to attending the concert with her friends, had to cancel her plans when her friends could not secure tickets. She explained, “My group of 10 had initially planned to purchase concert tickets. However, I was the only one who managed to get them.

Ultimately, we decided it was not worth the expense and opted instead to go for dinner on January 26.” Another fan, Aryan Patel, a student, mentioned, “I am not a Coldplay fan, although I have heard a couple of their songs. Given the considerable hype surrounding the event, I purchased four tickets, anticipating that my friends and I would attend. Unfortunately, after buying the tickets, none of my friends were willing to go, so I decided to sell them to other friends at the original price.” Some people even gave up their concert tickets for free because the dates coincided with prior work commitments or family weddings. Valsak Ansik, a 20-year-old student, stated, “I had no plans of attending the Coldplay concert, but two days ago, a close friend unexpectedly gave me three tickets. He had originally purchased the tickets for himself and his cousins. However, when he discovered that his sister's wedding dates coincided with the concert, he generously offered the tickets to me. As a result, my friends and I will be attending the concert.” Coldplay’s ‘Music of the Spheres World Tour’ is one of the most anticipated events for fans in India, but it has faced its share of controversies.

Former employee accused of data theft from real estate firm in Ahmedabad,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/former-employee-accused-of-data-theft-from-real-estate-firm-in-ahmedabad,2025-01-23,23,01,2025,"A case of alleged data theft has come to light in Ahmedabad, with a complaint filed by Vikrambhai Patel, proprietor of the real estate consultancy firm Techno Property Solutions. Patel has accused his former employee and two associates of stealing proprietary data from the company’s web portal to launch their competing business. According to the complaint, Patel, who has been running Techno Property Solutions for the past eight years from New York Tower in Thaltej, discovered the data theft in August 2024. The accused, Anil Vijaybhai Gaikwad, a former sales executive at Techno Property Solutions, allegedly used his familiarity with the company’s operations to steal its database. After leaving the company in 2020, Gaikwad partnered with Hemant Solki and Dhruv Ketankumar Mehta to establish a competing business, Vocal Connect Pvt Ltd, operating a portal named ProBroker from the Gujarat University Campus. Patel claimed that substantial amounts of data from his company’s portal (www.ahmedabad.technoproperty.in) were illegally accessed and uploaded onto ProBroker. Despite raising concerns with the directors of Vocal Connect Pvt. Ltd. in August 2024, Patel stated that he received no satisfactory explanation and observed continued data theft. In an attempt to verify his suspicions, Patel uploaded dummy property data on his company’s portal. Shortly after, the same data allegedly appeared on the portal of Vocal Connect Pvt Ltd, further substantiating the claims of unauthorised access. The complaint identifies Gaikwad, Solki, and Mehta as the primary accused in the case. Patel alleges that the trio systematically stole sensitive information to undermine his business. The Vastrapur Police Station has registered the complaint and launched an investigation. Authorities are expected to scrutinise digital evidence and examine the portals in question to determine the extent of the alleged data theft.",ahmedabad

The woman, with whom he was in a relationship, filed a complaint at the Ahmedabad West police station, accusing him of transferring a total of ₹2 crore in a span of 2.5 years. According to the complaint, the man who worked as an accountant for a Swaminarayan Trust in Ahmedabad, had met the woman, who arrived in the city from Delhi in search of a job. Both later had a relationship, and the man also arranged for a rented house for her in the Gota area. After gaining her trust, the man allegedly informed her about the ‘black money’ the trust received and convinced her to use her bank account. He would then withdraw the money from her account via cheques, making it legitimate. According to the complaint, when the woman discovered that the man was married, she wanted to end the relationship but refrained from it fearing legal action against the illegal transactions made from her bank account. Meanwhile, the woman also became pregnant during this period, the complaint states. A month ago, overwhelmed by stress caused by these transactions, the woman once again tried to end the relationship, but was threatened by the accused. The woman approached police, who have initiated an investigation into the matter. Also read : Gujarat HC rejects Wadi Swaminarayan priest’s bail plea in rape case",ahmedabad
"Tender for Hatkeshwar Bridge approved 4 months ago, but yet to take off, AMC accused of bias",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/tender-for-hatkeshwar-bridge-approved-4-months-ago-but-yet-to-take-off-amc-accused-of-bias,2025-01-23,23,01,2025,"Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has been accused of showing favouritism towards one contractor in allotment of tender for Hatkeshwar Bridge. The flyover bridge at Hatkeshwar junction, constructed at a cost of ₹40 crore, has been closed to the public for the past three years. While a Rajasthan-based company expressed interest in undertaking the ₹112 crore project to reconstruct the Hatkeshwar Bridge and completed the evaluation process by August 29, 2024, reliable sources indicate that political lobbying is being carried out to ensure that the project is awarded to Ajay Infra. After the bridge was closed to the public in 2021, a committee of experts recommended demolishing the existing superstructure and constructing a new bridge. Since 2023, the AMC has issued tenders four times to rebuild the bridge. Vishnuprasad Pungliya, a contractor from Rajasthan, initially offered to demolish the existing bridge and construct a new one for ₹118 crore. Meanwhile, Ajay Infra submitted a written request to the municipal commissioner on October 30, 2024, seeking the project for themselves. According to official sources within the municipal corporation, in the fifth round of tendering for the Hatkeshwar Bridge project, Vishnuprasad Pungliya once again emerged as the single bidder, offering ₹112 crore for the work. This offer was finalised after a technical meeting on August 23, 2024, followed by the evaluation’s completion on August 29, 2024. Despite this, no instructions have been issued to present the tender committee’s approval, even four months later. Also read : Cost of Hatkeshwar bridge doubles than initially estimated",ahmedabad
How an Ahmedabad man duped the Income Tax dept 60 times,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/how-an-ahmedabad-man-duped-the-income-tax-dept-60-times,2025-01-23,23,01,2025,"A man from Ahmedabad scammed the Income Tax (IT) department by presenting bogus documents for cash seized during raids, claiming it as his own, and then returning the cash to its original owners. Kamlesh Shah, a resident of Science City Road in Ahmedabad, has allegedly duped the IT department 60 times by claiming seized cash as his own during raids. By producing backdated documents stating that the cash belonged to him and he lent the money to companies, Shah successfully manipulated IT officers until his scam was finally uncovered. Shah’s wife Meena Shah, and associates Devang Jagdish Vyas, Gaurang Panchal from Navrangpura, and Ramesh Thakkar were also reportedly involved in the scam. Additionally, entities such as N R  Company in Ratanpole, Ahmedabad and N D Gold Jewellery LLP at C G Road were also named for their involvement in the scheme. Modus operandi During a raid in Ahmedabad, Delhi, or Mumbai, Shah would quickly prepare backdated documents showing that the confiscated cash belonged to him and had been provided to the raided company. He would approach the IT department with these documents, claiming the cash was his and linked to his agricultural business. Since agricultural income is primarily cash-based, it was easy for Shah to justify his claim. In cases where unaccounted cash is seized during raids, a hefty 77% tax is levied, along with a 6% penalty and additional interest. Together, these costs often exceed the amount of cash seized. To help companies avoid these financial burden, Shah would claim ownership of the cash and present it as legitimate business income, thus preventing the IT department from confiscating it. Once the cash was released, Shah would return it to the raided companies or promoters after deducting his 30% commission. Over time, Shah reportedly executed this scam in 60 cases. Shah’s fraudulent activities were not limited to Ahmedabad. Complaints have been registered against him in 60 different locations across the country for his involvement in this racket. By exploiting loopholes in the system and presenting himself as the owner of confiscated cash, Shah managed to dupe the IT department repeatedly. Also read : Special 7?

Gujarat HC cristices AMC for the non-maintenance of housing scheme in Behrampura,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-hc-cristices-amc-for-the-non-maintenance-of-housing-scheme-in-behrampura,2025-01-23,23,01,2025,"During the hearing regarding the poor condition of the housing scheme in Ahmedabad’s Behrampura, a bench led by Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Pranav Trivedi of Gujarat High Court criticised Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for failing to maintain the property and ordered the repairs. The apartments were built under a central government scheme and were handed over to the AMC. However, the houses have deteriorated to a dangerous state in just 10-15 years. Following sharp criticism, the court, the AMC has sprung into action. Expert opinions were quickly sought regarding the condition of these buildings, confirming that they are repairable. Consequently, AMC presented its willingness to carry out repairs before the court on Wednesday. The evaluation revealed that the buildings could be repaired rather than requiring complete reconstruction. These findings and proposed solutions, including repairs and reconstruction options, were submitted to the court on Wednesday. The reports for the same will be presented in the further hearing which is scheduled in February. What’s the issue raised in Gujarat High Court? The issue of deteriorating housing in Sikandar Bakht Nagar, Behrampura, was raised by residents in their appeal. These housing units were built under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) as part of a resettlement and rehabilitation initiative by the Urban Development Department. After construction, the housing was handed over to AMC, which allocated the houses between 2010 and 2014. Approximately 5,000 residents live across 992 flats in this housing project. However, over the short span of 10–15 years, these buildings have deteriorated to a dangerously unsafe condition. Due to safety concerns, AMC declared the buildings hazardous and issued notices under Section 265 of the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Act to all 992 flat owners on July 3, 2024, mandating repairs or demolition. In response to this alarming situation, the Gujarat High Court raised serious questions about accountability of the authorities and asked why proper oversight and maintenance were not ensured.

The security drill is aimed at ensuring the safety and smooth conduct of the event, which is expected to draw over two lakh attendees, including VIPs, VVIPs, and international visitors on the two days. Ahmedabad Commissioner of Police G S Malik along with senior officials from Sector-1 oversaw the arrangements. The security measures included the testing of metal detectors, CCTV cameras, baggage scanners, entry gates, and other equipment to ensure everything functioned seamlessly. The rehearsal also involved personnel coordination and thoroughly reviewing all arrangements within and around the stadium. Looking at the band's huge female following and female fans attending the concert, the Ahmedabad Police have specifically deployed an extra Mahila Police bandobast during the concert for women's safety. Foolproof security Under the Nirbhaya Project, a robust security setup has been deployed, comprising: - CCTV cameras: Monitoring key areas in and around the stadium. - Baggage scanners: 2 units for efficient screening. - Door frame metal detectors: 150 units installed at entry points. - Handheld metal detectors: 250 devices for on-the-spot checks. - Walkie-talkies: Ensuring seamless communication among officers. - Disaster management team: Equipped with evacuation plans, medical teams, and paramedical support, coordinating with the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority and fire services.

"Coldplay fans let down by high-priced hotels, opt for houses of Amdavadis to stay",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/coldplay-fans-let-down-by-high-priced-hotels-opt-for-houses-of-amdavadis-to-stay,2025-01-24,24,01,2025,"Coldplay has descended in Ahmedabad, and the city is buzzing with vibes of the magical fever that the British band has spread. “I cannot wait to witness the magical once-in-a-lifetime experience of Coldplay in Ahmedabad,” said Shubham Nagpal, a Delhite fan in a voice sparkling with joy. Everything seemed dreamy before reality hit— the hotel rates. One of the massive problems that Coldplay concert revellers have faced in the city is the exorbitant accommodation prices soaring as high as ₹50,000-₹1,00,000. A fan said that normal hotels which earlier provided rooms at the rate of ₹800 per night are providing rooms at the cost of ₹15,000, a massive 1,000% hike. “Coldplay came to India to cater for Indians with affordable ticket prices starting at ₹2,500, but Indian businesses have played dirty, costing our Delhi to Ahmedabad trip to ₹30,000 per person,” said Nagpal with disappointment. The mighty hotel alternative Amdavadis are not behind in seeking a business opportunity ahead of the concert, happening in the heart of the city, at Narendra Modi Stadium in Motera. Residents of areas near the airport and Narendra Modi Stadium are seizing the opportunity to rent out their homes or spare rooms on rent to the Coldplay fans. “While even one-star hotel prices were between ₹15,000 and ₹50,000, a localite offered us her spare 2BHK flat in the New Vatva area for just ₹5,000,” said Nagpal. Vrunda Mehta, a resident of Vastrapur when contacted, said she is willing to provide a room to a female Coldplay fan with no charges at all! Another Coldplay fan, Deepam Khattar, also a Delhite said that he doesn’t need accommodation as he will roam around the city after landing 12 hours before the concert. Discussions on Ahmedabad Reddit circles were also worth indulging in! One Redditor said, “It is not the infrastructure of the city, but the hotel owners of the city who are making it hard for Coldplay fans to visit Ahmedabad.” Smart fans claimed that they booked a cheap hotel in Vadodara, Gandhinagar, or nearby cities in Ahmedabad and will travel to Ahmedabad a few hours before the concert. Fans from Gujarat are either crashing their friends’ or relatives’ houses or just driving back to their district in Gujarat after the concert. Some fans did not make a wise choice though. To avoid accommodation expenses, a fan from Mumbai said on Reddit that he would travel by train to Ahmedabad and return by train after the concert, around 1.15 am. Now the catch is, that trains to Mumbai will arrive at Sabarmati Railway Station, which is 16 km from the stadium. Post-concert traffic will disappoint many fans who are planning to catch buses, trains or flights after the concert. But, it’s better to get going, then get stuck in the city.

According to customs officials, the passengers were likely carrying this advance payment for gold smuggling from Dubai. Both passengers have been detained by customs. Preliminary investigations suggest that the passengers were likely carrying this advance payment to facilitate gold smuggling. Officials are currently recording the statements of both passengers to gather more details. Arrests may follow after determining the source of the money and the intended recipients in Dubai. As per customs regulations, possession of foreign currency exceeding ₹50 lakh leads to immediate arrest. In this case, the investigation is ongoing. This marks the second such case of dollar seizure at Ahmedabad airport within two days. Just a day earlier, customs had seized $19,000 hidden inside a passenger’s slippers who was also traveling to Dubai on a SpiceJet flight. Given the back-to-back incidents, customs officials at Ahmedabad International Airport have intensified surveillance on passengers traveling to Dubai with large amounts of foreign currency.

The event has caused a significant rise in demand for flights as people from across the country have bought tickets for the British band’s concert. Here’s a breakdown of the flight fares from various cities to Ahmedabad on regular days and on January 25: Flight Fares to Ahmedabad Flight Fares to Ahmedabad on January 25 Route Fare on 25th January (INR) Goa to Ahmedabad 8,724 - 13,554 Mumbai to Ahmedabad 10,524 - 24,198 Pune to Ahmedabad 12,019 - 18,123 Delhi to Ahmedabad 13,500 - 26,269 Chennai to Ahmedabad 15,177 - 21,597 Kochi to Ahmedabad 15,049 - 27,168 Bangalore to Ahmedabad 17,500 - 33,887 Jaipur to Ahmedabad 11,234 - 37,549 Puducherry to Ahmedabad 25,023 - 37,529 Minimum fare: Goa to Ahmedabad The lowest one-way flight fare for January 25 from Goa to Ahmedabad, starts at ₹8,724, which is still more than double the normal fare of ₹3,500. Maximum fare: Puducherry to Ahmedabad Among all the routes, the highest one-way flight fare on January 25 is from Puducherry to Ahmedabad, with ticket prices ranging from ₹25,023 to 37,529. This is higher than fares from other cities, highlighting the strain on capacity and demand from smaller airports. Notably, Maharashtra can gain economically, with over 59,000 travelling to Ahmedabad for the Coldplay concert. This number far surpasses the contributions from other states, with over 11,200 people from Delhi, 1,200 fans from Goa, over 6000 from Telangana, and 7,500 plus from Rajasthan. The large turnout from Maharashtra is expected to economically boost local travel agencies, airlines, and other supporting sectors. Raj Deshani, a frequent flier from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, mentioned that on normal days, the flight price is around ₹1,800 to ₹2,000. However, due to the Coldplay concert, the prices have surged to ₹10,524. Even at the last minute, the price hovers around ₹3,500, but now, the concert has pushed the fares significantly higher. Delhi resident Shreyansh Agarwal  will fly for the concert on Friday. He had to shell out ₹10,500 for a one-way fare when he booked the ticket on Tuesday.The airfare for the same route is around ₹3,000. He said, “I had no other option as I am handling my family business. I could not leave early for the train, and as per my convenience, flight was the only option for which I had to pay ₹10,500.” The surging flight prices have resulted in several people being forced to sell their Coldplay tickets. Notably, an international flight from Ahmedabad to Vietnam costs just ₹14,500, making it cheaper than many domestic flights to Ahmedabad during the concert period.

RSS leader says ‘violence is necessary to protect non-violence’ at Ahmedabad event,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/rss-leader-says-is-necessary-to-protect-non-at-ahmedabad-event,2025-01-24,24,01,2025,"Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi has raised eyebrows with his statement during a Hindu spiritual event in Ahmedabad. “Sometimes, violence becomes necessary to protect the principle of non-violence,” Bhaiyyaji Joshi said. At the inauguration of the Hindu Spiritual & Service Fair (HSSF), better known as Hindu Adhyatmik Seva Mela, organised by the RSS at the Gujarat University grounds on Thursday, Joshi remarked, “The principle of non-violence is deeply embedded in Hinduism and cannot be denied. However, at times, to protect the idea of non-violence, one has to resort to violence. If this is not done, the very idea of non-violence will not remain secure. Our great ancestors have passed this message down to us.” Referring to the Mahabharata, he added that even the Pandavas had to overlook the rules of war to eliminate adharma (unrighteousness). He further stated, “If any religion does not allow people the freedom to practice their faith, then peace cannot be established. There is no other country besides India that is capable of leading the entire world together. The concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) is rooted in our spirituality.” “If we accept the world as one family, there will be no conflicts. When we say that India must be made strong, we are assuring the world that a strong India and a strong Hindu community are in everyone’s interest. This is because we protect the weak and underprivileged. This is the ideology that connects Hindus around the world,” he added. Joshi emphasised that “Hinduism encompasses religion, spirituality, philosophy, lifestyle, values of life, and service. Hindu religious and spiritual institutions are not limited to rituals or ceremonies alone. They also run many service-oriented initiatives such as schools, hospitals, and Vedic knowledge gurukuls, and they have always been engaged in service. When we talk about religion, the duty of service naturally arises.” He also pointed out that, “A misconception has been created worldwide that only certain communities engage in service. However, in India, there is a tradition where bhandaras, langars, and food distribution centres operate continuously. In these, around one crore people receive meals daily.” The fair was inaugurated by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the presence of Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel among other leaders.

The raid led to the seizure of 107 kg of Alprazolam worth ₹107 crore and 1,518 kg of other chemicals used in its production. Acting on specific intelligence provided by a trusted informant, a team led by Deputy Superintendent of Police Harsh Upadhyay raided Greenlife Industries in Neja village. Arrests and seizure The raid resulted in the arrest of five persons named Ranjit Dabhi, Vijay Makwana, Hemant Patel, Lalaji Makwana and Jaideep Makwana. Authorities also confiscated ₹20 lakh in cash from Ranjit Dabhi, allegedly received for the production of Alprazolam. Dabhi, the owner of Satyam Traders, along with Vijay Makwana and Hemant Patel, who previously worked in chemical manufacturing, ran the illegal operation. Lalaji and Jaideep Makwana assisted them in the factory. The investigation revealed that the accused supplied the narcotic substance to one Ajay Jain, a repeat offender previously convicted in cases registered with the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). Massive drug production potential The seized quantity of Alprazolam could have been used to manufacture an estimated 42.8 crore tablets, each containing 0.15 grams of the drug. Alprazolam is a prescription medication for anxiety disorders, but is often abused as a recreational drug, making its illegal manufacturing a severe offence under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Probe widens Following the raid, Ajay Jain was apprehended in Nandurbar, Madhya Pradesh, by the Gujarat ATS team. Jain has a history of involvement in drug-related offences and had previously served a 16-year sentence for similar crimes. The ATS has registered a case under the NDPS Act and is continuing its investigation to uncover further links and networks related to this illegal operation. The assistance of local police from Khambhat played a crucial role in the successful execution of the raid.",ahmedabad

However, even after two months, the hospital remains non-operational. Since the hospital has not commenced operations, residents of Khadia and Jamalpur wards are unable to access essential healthcare services. According to sources, internal political slugfest among BJP leaders in Khadia over claiming credit for the renovation is allegedly one of the reasons for delay in making the hospital operational. The hospital, located in the Raipur area, once served a large number of patients, providing a range of treatments. Notably, during the tenure of the late Ashok Bhatt as the state’s health minister, he secured approval from the Health department to deploy Ahmedabad Civil Hospital’s medical staff to this hospital. After his demise, the building allegedly fell into disrepair. Following repeated appeals by the current Khadia ward corporators, the AMC decided in 2022 to restore the dilapidated hospital building. The Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Health and Hospitals) officially informed the Civil Hospital’s medical superintendent about the need to appoint staff to begin operations at the hospital two months ago, when the restoration work was completed. On January 16, 2025, Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner M Thennarasan wrote to the Principal Secretary of the State Health department, and on January 17, 2025, Standing Committee Chairman Devang Dani made a written request to the State Health minister to allocate staff for the hospital.

For instance, Ola fares from Maninagar to Stadium stand at ₹319, with SG Highway priced at ₹234, and Rapido fares from SG Highway typically range between ₹309 and ₹472 from Shela.

The containers, which were labelled to contain low-cost fabric, were suspected of carrying high-quality textiles, with the misdeclaration made to evade tax duties. Authorities initiated the operation after receiving information about the malpractice. Preliminary investigations suggest that the value of the fabric inside the containers far exceeds the declared price of ₹25 crore. Sources from DRI revealed that similar shipments have been intercepted at other major ports, including Mumbai’s Nhava Sheva Port also known as Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT), raising questions about the scale of the operation. With the seizure of these 100 containers, the DRI has launched a nationwide investigation to identify the culprits behind the illegal imports and trace the goods to their final destinations across India. Authorities are also working to uncover the networks of importers involved and whether similar schemes are being run at other ports. China’s textile imports are heavily taxed due to concerns about unfair pricing, with a 90% anti-dumping duty applied to such goods. However, smugglers have found ways to exploit the system, with reports indicating that certain types of clothing, such as undergarments, have been cleared without duty, while higher-end items like jackets and shirts attract a fixed duty. Importers are accused of declaring low-duty items while secretly bringing in higher-value goods, bypassing millions in taxes.

At that time, Namita Singhania, a receiver of the bribe on behalf of Meena was nabbed. In this case, Special Public Prosecutor R J Gogda, on behalf of the ACB, drew the court's attention to the fact that the accused is a high-ranking government official and has committed a serious offence by illegally demanding and accepting a bribe from the complainant, abusing his position and authority. The investigation agency has also recorded the conversation between the complainant and the accused regarding the demand for a bribe. This conversation also proves the fact that the accused demanded a bribe. Prima facie evidence suggests that a serious case has been established against the accused, providing sufficient grounds for filing a charge sheet and proceeding with a trial. This evidence has also been presented in the court records by the prosecution.

One Praveen Patel claimed to be associated with a Swaminarayan trust in Ahmedabad, was accused of using a woman’s bank account for money laundering.

After gaining her trust, Patel allegedly informed her about the ‘black money’ the trust received and convinced her to use her bank account.

With skyrocketed airfares and long railway waiting lists, the GSRTC trip package offered a ray of hope, only to be booked to capacity in no time. Tickets for this service were sold out within an hour of the opening of the booking, and all tickets until February 25 were fully booked. This quick sell-out of tickets for 30 days left many pilgrims disappointed. The special bus service will commence on January 27. It will depart daily at 7 am from Ranip ST Depot in Ahmedabad to Prayagraj. The fare for the 3-day, 4-night trip is ₹8,100 per person. Middlemen involvement? Ticket bookings opened at midnight on January 25, and within an hour, all 1,380 tickets available until February 25 were sold. Many who tried booking tickets in the morning found all dates until February 25 marked as ‘booked’ leading to disappointment. The bus has a seating capacity of 46 passengers. Over the next 30 days, 1,380 passengers are expected to travel from Ahmedabad to Prayagraj. The rapid ticket sell-out has fueled speculation that BJP MLAs and corporators may have pre-reserved tickets for their ‘supporters’. Critics argue it is otherwise implausible for all tickets to be sold so quickly. This ticket sale is expected to generate over ₹1.11 crore in revenue for GSRTC. Rajkot-Prayagraj GSRTC buses?

The GSRTC’s special bus service is said to be accessible only to those with the right 'connections', as tickets are nearly impossible to secure. This has led to growing demands for more buses and trains to be introduced for Mahakumbh. Private bus services triple in 10 days At the start of Mahakumbh, there were only five private buses operating between Ahmedabad and Prayagraj.

If no alliance happens, AAP will contest in all municipal elections independently.” On the other hand, NCP, which formed an alliance in Maharashtra, will contest the local self-government elections in Gujarat independently. The NCP is prepared to contest the district and municipal elections.

Bangalore CEO praises Ahmedabad’s infrastructure during visit for Coldplay concert,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/bangalore-ceo-praises-ahmedabads-infrastructure-during-visit-for-coldplay-concert,2025-01-27,27,01,2025,"Siddharth Dialani, the CEO and founder of Bharatagri, took to social media to share his thoughts on Ahmedabad’s infrastructure following his visit to the city for the Coldplay concert. Dialani, who is based in Bangalore, was clearly impressed by the stark contrast in the road quality, traffic management, and overall urban development between the two cities. In a post on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Dialani expressed that Ahmedabad is “at least 10 years ahead of Bangalore” when it comes to road quality, footpaths, traffic signals, and overall traffic management. He pointed out that the city’s traffic signals were equipped with working timers and bright lights, something he felt was lacking in his home city, Bangalore. Dialani further criticised Bangalore’s infrastructure, remarking that the city was “in shambles”. He noted the dusty environment in Bangalore, which he claimed made it difficult to even see signal lights properly. In contrast, Ahmedabad’s well-maintained roads and clear signage stood out to him. Reflecting on the difference between the two cities, Dialani shared, “Looking at Bangalore, I used to believe that Indian road quality is going down. After looking at Ahmedabad, I realised that it’s not India, it’s just Bangalore!” Dialani also commented on the lighting in Ahmedabad, noting how well-lit the city was, especially at night, contributing to a brighter and more vibrant atmosphere. He observed that this visibility seemed to have a positive effect on the people, who appeared generally happy and smiling. He posed a thought-provoking question: “Is that why people are generally sad and angry in Bangalore?” He emphasised that in contrast, Bangalore suffers from poor street lighting, with even basic street lights often not working. Dialani’s observations have sparked a conversation about the urban development gap between Bangalore and Ahmedabad, with many local citizens and urban planners taking note of the CEO’s critique and praise.

Style meets strategy as Gujarat University orders blazers for non teaching staff ahead of NAAC inspection,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/style-meets-strategy-as-gujarat-university-orders-blazers-for-staff-ahead-of-naac-inspection,2025-01-27,27,01,2025,"Ahead of the NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) inspection scheduled for Gujarat University on January 28-30, the university is reportedly leaving no stone unturned to succeed. Among these efforts, they have ordered 400 tailored grey blazers for non-teaching staff. As per reports, the vice chancellor of the university explained the blazer initiative, stating that the non-teaching staff had requested something special for them. Acting on their request, the university arranged for the blazers. Additionally, the university conducted a faculty training programme on January 18 to gear up for the inspection. The five-year validity of Gujarat University’s last NAAC accreditation ended in 2020. However, due to the pandemic and other factors, the university did not apply for a new accreditation cycle until now. Previously, the university was ranked B++ by NAAC. Notably, for the past four years, Gujarat University has consistently been ranked among the top 100 in national rankings and has also performed well in state ratings by the Gujarat government. Achieving an A++ grade in the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) accreditation is now a critical goal for the university, and considerable efforts are being made towards this. With many private and government universities in the state already earning A++ or A+ grades from NAAC, Gujarat University is aiming for the highest possible accreditation from the council. Although the state’s largest and oldest government university frequently ranks among the top universities in India and globally, securing an A++ grade from NAAC has remained a challenge. The NAAC inspection team is scheduled to visit Gujarat University after January 28. Given the university’s size, the team will consist of five to seven members, and the inspection will span three days, focusing on various evaluation criteria.

Gujarat ATS seizes 500 kg of Tramadol in major drug bust in Ahmedabad,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-ats-seizes-500-kg-of-tramadol-in-major-drug-bust-in-ahmedabad,2025-01-28,28,01,2025,"In a significant blow to the illegal drug trade in Gujarat, the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) of the state seized 500 kg of Tramadol, an opioid painkiller often referred to as the 'fighter drug', from a warehouse in Dholka, Ahmedabad. The haul, valued at an estimated ₹50 crore, marks one of the largest seizures of the drug since its classification as a psychotropic substance under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in 2018. The raid was the culmination of intelligence gathered during an earlier operation in Anand district on January 24, where the ATS had uncovered 107 kg of Alprazolam worth ₹107 crore at Greenlife Industries in Neja village in Khambhat taluka. Alongside the drugs, ₹30 lakh in cash was seized, and six suspects were arrested. During the investigation, one of the accused, Ranjit Dabhi, revealed the existence of a larger consignment of Tramadol stored in warehouse No. 54 at Devam Industries Estate in Dholka. Acting on this tip, an ATS team conducted a raid on the Dholka warehouse and discovered approximately 49,800 boxes containing Tramadol, along with 6 km of packaging foil rolls. Investigators estimate that the drug had been stored in the warehouse for over eight months. Tramadol has earned notoriety as the 'fighter drug' due to reports of its use by ISIS fighters to endure extended periods of combat. The psychotropic substance has a history of abuse, particularly in regions where it is smuggled and consumed illicitly. Its export is strictly regulated under the NDPS Act. “This seizure is a major breakthrough in our efforts to dismantle the illegal drug trade in Gujarat. The consignment was likely intended for export to West African nations such as Sierra Leone and Niger, though this is still under investigation,” said K Siddharth, Superintendent of Police, Gujarat ATS. Preliminary findings suggest that Dabhi had rented the warehouse exclusively for storing the contraband. The drugs were reportedly manufactured elsewhere and brought to the warehouse to be sold in the black market. However, ATS operations in August 2024, which resulted in the seizure of 1,410 litres of liquid Tramadol—a precursor used in the production of Tramadol —from a pharmaceutical facility in Dahej, had significantly disrupted Dabhi’s plans to offload the consignment. Officials believe Dabhi had refrained from selling the drugs following increased scrutiny from law enforcement. “The consignment remained unsold due to the risk of detection. ATS operations kept a close tab on potential transactions, which likely forced the accused to store the drugs temporarily,” Siddharth added. The investigation is now focusing on identifying the source of the Tramadol and tracing the network involved in its manufacture, storage, and distribution. The ATS is also probing the possibility of additional undisclosed batches being stored or sold by Dabhi in the past.",ahmedabad

Boost to travel, hospitality, and food industries The concert days contributed substantially to the local economy. Metro services reported around 4 lakh passengers over the two days, generating ₹66 lakh in revenue. Additionally, ride aggregator services experienced a surge in demand, further contributing to both the city and national economy. Hotel prices skyrocketed during the concert period, with room rates reaching up to ₹13,000 per night on average and the price even exceeded ₹2 lakh per night stay on concert day. Most attendees were from outside Ahmedabad and even from other states, significantly benefiting the hospitality sector, including private home stays. The food industry also saw a surge in demand, with restaurants packed and food delivery orders increasing sharply. India as a concert destination The successful hosting of the Coldplay concert demonstrates India’s capability to accommodate large-scale international events. This success is likely to attract more global artists and concerts in the future, further boosting the country’s event and tourism industry. Following Coldplay’s success, many fans are hopeful that Taylor Swift may now consider including India in her global tour schedule, further cementing India’s status as a preferred destination for world-class performances.

The much-awaited performance by Cigarettes After Sex (CAS) band in Bengaluru on January 28, 2025, was abruptly cancelled due to technical and production issues, leaving fans ‘heartbroken’, just 20 minutes before the gates were scheduled to open. Sharing the last-minute cancellation news, CAS wrote on X, “Unfortunately the local production had technical difficulties they couldn’t fix. We tried everything we could to make the show happen, but the problems are with the local production & beyond our control. We waited months & months to see you & are heartbroken.” Ahmedabad, a concert capital? Users immediately suggested shifting the concert to Ahmedabad after a successful hosting of over 2  lakh fans of Coldplay concerts on January 25 and 26. “The Cigarettes After Sex concert in Bangalore got cancelled due to “technical issues”, in the tech capital of the country, Lol. Meanwhile, cities like Ahmedabad are successfully hosting concerts and boosting the concert economy,” an X user commented. “Sad.. next time shift your venue to the place which is managed well like in Ahmedabad,” another user wrote. “Sorry to say Ahmedabad is better.” “Just come to Ahmedabad.” The last-minute cancellation comes amid the discussions of Ahmedabad’s successful hosting of the international concert. Fans took the rant on social media and criticised the band’s team for cancelling it after they were already at the venue. A fan wrote, “Wasted my whole day in traffic.” An influencer took to her Instagram and wrote, “It’s absolutely shameful that after an entire year of anticipation, the event has been cancelled at the last minute due to “venue and production” issues.” “How is that even a valid excuse? People have spent thousands on flights, not to mention the time, effort, and excitement invested in this. If organizing it properly was impossible, why wait until the very last moment to inform everyone? Now, Rida and her friends are stuck in traffic with no way out because they arrived early, expecting a well-planned event. The sheer lack of responsibility and communication is just pathetic,” she added. Earlier, a Bengaluru-based CEO of Bharatagri, Siddharth Dialani, had praised Ahmedabad’s infrastructure after attending the Coldplay concert in the city, claiming that the road quality, traffic management and urban infrastructure was much better than Bengaluru.",ahmedabad

Based on the complaint, the police have registered an FIR under various sections of cheating and cyber fraud against both accused right now and the authorities are now investigating the bank transactions, WhatsApp communications, and IP addresses used by the accused.",ahmedabad

Over 110 cases of GBS have been reported. A 41-year-old chartered accountant became the first confirmed casualty in Pune on Monday. So, what is this rarely heard, but potentially severe neurological disorder that has garnered attention in recent times due to its impact on public health. Gujarat Samachar Digital talked to Dr Urvi Patel, a leading consulting physician and intensivist to gain an insight into the Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). What are its symptoms, causes, and prevention strategies?. Why has GBS gained attention recently? GBS came into the spotlight following the CA’s tragic death in Pune and 110 cases in the region. Health authorities are investigating the factors contributing to this sudden increase, which has raised concerns among medical professionals and the public. Dr Patel highlighted the importance of increased awareness, early diagnosis, and preventive measures in light of these alarming developments. What is Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)? GBS is a rare demyelinating neurological condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nervous system. This often occurs following an infection, such as a viral illness or bacterial infection. Dr Patel emphasised that GBS is autoimmune and non-communicable, meaning it does not spread from person to person. Symptoms of GBS GBS is the rapid onset of progressive and ascending motor weakness, often leading to paralysis. Dr Patel explained, “Symptoms typically start in the legs and may progress to involve the upper body. This progression occurs over a few hours to days.” Other warning signs include numbness, tingling, and altered sensations. GBS often follows gastrointestinal or respiratory infections. Dr Patel noted that patients may report a history of loose motions, abdominal pain, or respiratory symptoms such as cough and cold before the onset of GBS. How to detect GBS To check for potential signs of GBS, Dr Patel recommended performing a sensory examination, which involves testing for light touch, temperature, pain, and vibration sensations. Early detection can play a crucial role in preventing severe complications. GBS is also known by several other names, including: Landry’s Ascending Paralysis Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP) Acute Idiopathic Polyradiculoneuritis Acute Idiopathic Polyneuritis French Polio Landry Guillain-Barre Syndrome Causes and risk factors The primary culprit behind GBS is the bacterial organism Campylobacter jejuni, which is associated with gastrointestinal infections. It can occur at any age but primarily affects older adults, especially those over 50 years old, as well as children. Mortality and morbidity rate The mortality rate for GBS ranges between 3% and 13%, with respiratory failure, pneumonia, cardiac arrest, and autonomic dysfunction being the leading causes of death. The risk of death increases with age, severity of weakness, and prolonged ICU stays. In terms of morbidity, a significant number of survivors experience long-term motor deficits. “Around 15-20% of patients have moderate residual deficits, while 1-10% are severely disabled. A small percentage may experience an acute relapse after initial improvement.” Prevention strategies Food safety: Avoid undercooked poultry, unpasteurised milk, and untreated water. Hygiene: Maintain proper hygiene practices, including regular hand washing before meals and after using the toilet. Water safety: Use filtered or boiled water for drinking. Food consumption: Avoid eating at unhygienic places. Early medical intervention: Seek medical help immediately upon noticing symptoms to prevent the progression of GBS and its complications.

The remarks came during the hearing of a contempt petition filed by advocate Amit Panchal pertaining to stray cattle, deteriorating roads, illegal parking and encroachment on footpaths. During the hearing, Justice Supehia shared a personal experience at a T-junction where there was heavy traffic despite a police station being just 200 metres away. Upon getting out of his car to assess the situation, he observed a traffic constable inside the police station using his mobile phone instead of managing the traffic. Sharing this, he questioned, “What are these constables being paid for?” and criticised the police department for its inefficiency. The court further highlighted that road encroachments have increased, and even when stalls are seized, people often remain, sit, and protest, occupying 50% of the road space. As a result, there is no space left for vehicles or pedestrians. The court directed the authorities to permanently remove encroachments and ensure they do not return. Advocate Amit Panchal pointed out that despite the case ongoing for the past 6-7 years with 102 hearings and 62 court orders, the authorities have failed to take appropriate action or comply with the court’s directives. He urged the court to take strict action against those responsible and move the case forward. The next hearing is scheduled for February 6. Case hearing highlights Traffic jams and encroachments The court noted that people are severely affected by traffic congestion and encroachments on roads. Authorities only seem to act during court hearings and revert to inaction afterward. Lack of law enforcement Despite having laws in place, enforcement is poor. The court stressed that legal compliance should occur even in the absence of court hearings. Strict measures necessary Court assistant Bhaskar Tanna emphasised that “fear is essential for compliance”. He suggested implementing strict penalties and effective surveillance through cameras to address the situation. Non-compliance by authorities The court criticised authorities for failing to implement its orders, terming it a violation and disrespect of the High Court’s directives. The court indicated that charges may be filed against responsible officers.

The project was successful, prompting the decision to install sensors in 19 underpasses throughout the city. These sensors will monitor water levels, and once the level reaches 60 cm, boom barrier gates will automatically close. Additionally, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology will be used to monitor water levels on the roof of the underpass. Sensors installed on the walls and footpaths of the underpasses will also help monitor and detect rainwater accumulation. During the monsoon, the system will send water level updates to the municipal control room every ten seconds. If the water level exceeds the predetermined limit, the software will automatically send a signal to close the boom barriers at the underpass entrances.

The complaint, registered at Vasna police station, accuses Ashok Rathore of persistently following and harassing the complainant, both in person and through CCTV surveillance. According to the complaint, Sunita (name changed) who has been residing with her husband and two children in Vasna for the past 17 years, has been subjected to ongoing harassment by Rathore. The accused, a relative of her husband's family, allegedly engaged in inappropriate behaviour, including standing outside his house in revealing clothing, making lewd gestures, and loitering outside her residence under false pretences. Sunita stated that Rathore frequently followed her on his motorcycle when she went to pick up her child from a relative's home. She refrained from reporting the matter earlier due to family ties and fear of social embarrassment. However, the situation escalated when Rathore allegedly began speaking loudly on his phone outside her house, using abusive language and attempting to provoke confrontations. Four months ago, after informing her husband of the ongoing harassment, her mother-in-law reprimanded the accused, but the behaviour continued. Matters worsened when, three months ago, Rathore allegedly engaged in a heated argument with the complainant in front of her house, leading to a physical altercation with her husband. Rathore later filed a counter-complaint against her husband at Vasna police station, further complicating the dispute. Sunita further alleged that Rathore installed a CCTV camera outside his house, directing it towards her home to monitor her activities. Despite initially removing the camera following police intervention, he reinstalled a new device within days. She claimed that he actively rotated the camera to track her movements whenever she stepped outside. Family members, including her sister-in-law and brother-in-law, attempted to reason with the accused during the recent Uttarayan festival, but Rathore refused to cease his actions. The complainant has now demanded a legal inquiry into the matter, citing persistent stalking, psychological distress, and the accused’s deliberate attempts to provoke confrontations. Authorities have launched an investigation under relevant sections of the law pertaining to stalking, harassment, and criminal intimidation.",ahmedabad

The complainant, Payal Vaghela, a resident of Adalaj, Gandhinagar, married Mansinghji Vaghela in 2012. She initially lived with her husband and in-laws in Makarba, Ahmedabad, where she claims she was treated well for five years. However, she alleges that her husband's drinking habits and abusive behaviour began after that period, leading to constant disputes. According to the complaint, Payal's husband developed a close relationship with another woman, Tamanna, which led to frequent arguments. She claims that whenever she confronted him, he would verbally abuse her and physically assault her. The situation allegedly worsened despite her mother-in-law’s reassurances that he would change. Payal further states that in October 2024, her husband moved in with Tamanna, leaving her and their daughter to fend for themselves. Later, on November 15, 2024, he returned, allegedly threatening her, saying, ""If you don’t give me a divorce, I will make your daughter disappear within two days."" The situation escalated when he visited her home with Tamanna and demanded that Payal leave, claiming he wanted to settle down with the other woman. Feeling helpless, Payal called the police, but no formal complaint was lodged at the time. Instead, her husband and Tamanna left, while she returned to her in-laws' house with her brother-in-law. After enduring continued mistreatment, Payal finally decided to file an official complaint, citing both physical and mental harassment. She has named her husband, mother-in-law, and other family members in the case, alleging that they actively supported her husband’s actions and failed to intervene.

"Jewellery heist in Ahmedabad: Thieves stash booty, return to find it’s gone!",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/jewellery-heist-in-ahmedabad-thieves-stash-booty-return-to-find-its-gone,2025-02-04,4,02,2025,"In a bizarre twist to the high-profile Kanakpura Jewellers robbery case in Bopal, Ahmedabad, the four arrested accused have claimed that the stolen jewellery, worth ₹73.1 lakh, was stolen after they had buried it in a secluded spot. This revelation has left investigators baffled, as efforts to recover the loot have so far been unsuccessful. The armed robbery, which took place on January 2, saw four masked assailants storm Kanakpura Jewellers in South Bopal at gunpoint. They made away with a significant haul of gold and silver jewellery, fleeing the scene within minutes. After their arrest, the accused led the police to their supposed hiding spot, only to find the stolen jewellery missing. Thieves lose the booty According to police officials, the accused had initially fled to a desolate area covered in thick bushes, roughly 500 metres from the crime scene. In an attempt to evade detection, they allegedly dug a hole in the bushes and buried the bag containing the jewellery before dispersing. Between 4.40 pm and 5.15 pm, the group completed their task and left the area. Later that night, around 8.30 pm, three of the accused returned to the site to retrieve the loot. However, despite searching for hours, they were unable to locate the bag. The jewellery had mysteriously disappeared. During interrogation, the trio narrated the same sequence of events, though investigators remain sceptical. A police search team was dispatched with JCB machines to excavate the area, but no valuables were found. Superintendent of Ahmedabad Rural Police, Om Prakash Jat said, “We do not completely believe the story spun by the accused, but we cannot dismiss it either. We are investigating all possibilities. To verify their claims, all four accused have undergone narco-analysis tests. The results will confirm whether their version of events is truthful or a fabrication.” Did someone witness the hiding of the jewels? If the accused are indeed telling the truth, police suspect that some unknown individual might have seen them hiding the bag and later stolen it. Since the area is on the city’s outskirts, there are no CCTV cameras nearby to confirm their claims. However, investigators have retrieved footage showing the accused heading towards the spot after the robbery and later leaving the area. Unfortunately, multiple people were seen moving in the vicinity, making it difficult to track a possible suspect. Background of the heist The robbery of jewellery occurred in broad daylight around 3.45 pm on January 2, when four masked robbers stormed the Kanakpura Jewellers on Gymkhana Road. Holding the shop owner, Bharat Soni, and staff at gunpoint, they swiftly looted gold, silver, and other valuables before escaping on a stolen motorcycle. The vehicle was later abandoned approximately one kilometre from the crime scene. Extensive police investigations led to the identification and arrest of the accused in Uttar Pradesh, following a meticulous analysis of over 300 CCTV cameras and mobile tracking. The suspects—Birendrakumar Chandrapal Khatik, Javed alias Patri, Amarsingh Madhavsingh, and Jotsingh Mewaram—were all apprehended, but the stolen jewellery remains unaccounted for. Mastermind behind the robbery Police revealed that Birendrakumar Khatik, the mastermind, had prior knowledge of Ahmedabad’s geography due to his work in the telecom sector. He, along with Javed and two security guards from Bopal, planned the heist over weeks, selecting Kanakpura Jewellers for its relatively isolated location. The gang carried out multiple reconnaissance visits before executing the robbery.",ahmedabad

An NSUI leader took tomato sauce, samosas, maskabun, and other food items  from the canteen and gave the samples of it to the Amdavad Municipal Corporation’s public health laboratory for testing. The findings indicated that ingredients of maskabun and samosas were of 'substandard quality'. Earlier, NSUI wrote a complaint to the university questioning the allotment of the canteen contract through a short-notice offline tender process. They argued that this violates established norms and procedures. The complaint states that the previous vice-chancellor had established a souvenir shop called ‘Vidya Shri Centre’ on the university campus. This shop sold university-branded merchandise. However, the Vidya Shri centre has been closed for some time. Now, the university has allotted the space to a canteen operator through a short-notice offline tender process. The complaint alleged that the allotted canteen lacks the necessary licenses and permits, including a food licence and a GST registration. Additionally, the canteen is reportedly using domestic gas cylinders instead of commercial ones, raising safety concerns.

"Gujarat accounts for highest seizure of sex toys, 600 seized in Ahmedabad in 3 years",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-accounts-for-highest-seizure-of-toys-600-seized-in-ahmedabad-in-3-years,2025-02-05,5,02,2025,"Customs officials have seized over 600 sex toys, which fall in the  category of banned items, from the Foreign Post Office (FPO) in Shahibaug, Ahmedabad in the past three years. According to reports, Customs officials seized 165 sex toys in 2022, 270 sex toys in 2023, and 165 sex toys in 2024 from the FPO. The Customs Act bans sale of ‘obscene materials’, so sex toys are imported in baggage, parcels and containers from the US, UK and other countries. As much as 90% of sex toys seized from the FPO are imported from the US and 10% from the UK. The highest seizure of sex toys in India has been found to be in Gujarat, with 40% of sex toys seized in the country coming from the state. In Gujarat, the sale of this type of sex toys were recorded in Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara, Jamnagar, Anand, Nadiad and Valsad. These toys were ordered from overseas e-commerce websites. Are sex toys banned in India? Sex toys exist in a legal grey area in India. While there is no specific law that explicitly bans sex toys, their sale, distribution, and public display are restricted under Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which criminalises the sale and circulation of ‘obscene’ materials. Customs laws also prohibit the import of sex toys, classifying them as obscene objects. Also read: Teenagers from Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Palanpur among 150 drug buyers in Gujarat",ahmedabad
"Man poisons son, attempts suicide in Ahmedabad",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/man-poisons-son-attempts-in-ahmedabad,2025-02-05,5,02,2025,"A 47-year-old man allegedly poisoned his 10-year-old son before attempting to take his own life in Bapunagar, Ahmedabad. The accused, identified as Kalpeshbhai Govindbhai Gohel, resides in Government E Colony, opposite Narmada Society near Khalsa School. According to the complaint filed by Kalpesh’s elder brother, Yogeshbhai Gohel, the tragic incident occurred on the morning of February 4, 2025 around 9.30 am. Yogeshbhai, a resident of Chandkheda, was informed by his son Mihir that their 15-year-old niece, Jiya, had called to report that her younger brother, Om, had suddenly fallen ill and was rushed to Shardaben Hospital. Upon reaching the hospital, Yogeshbhai and his wife were devastated to learn that Om had been declared dead. After questioning Jiya, they discovered that on the morning of the incident, their mother had gone out, leaving Kalpesh alone at home with his children and their elderly parents. Jiya recounted that her father had given both her and Om some medicine to prevent vomiting. Shortly afterward, Om began experiencing severe stomach pain and vomiting, and his lips turned blue. Confession and Arrest When confronted at the Bapunagar Police Station later that afternoon, Kalpesh allegedly confessed to poisoning his son by dissolving 30 grams of sodium nitrite in water and making him drink it. Investigators are gathering evidence, including statements from family members and forensic analysis of the substance used. Following the incident, authorities were alerted, and an investigation was launched. The Bapunagar police have registered a case under Section 103(1) of the BNS Act. Officials have confirmed that Kalpesh has been taken into custody. His motive for the alleged crime remains unclear, and authorities are probing whether it was premeditated or carried out under mental distress.",ahmedabad

According to reports, the deportees include two from Ahmedabad, 12 each from Mehsana and Gandhinagar, four from Surat, one from Vadodara, one from Patan, and one from Kheda.

Punjab NRI Affairs Minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal expressed disappointment over the US decision to deport the Indians, saying they have contributed to the US economy and should have been granted permanent residency, instead of being deported. Director General of Police (DGP) Gaurav Yadav said that Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann said from the Punjab government's side, “we will receive our immigrants and set up counters for them there (at the airport).” “We are in touch with the Centre. As and when information comes, we will share,” he told the media here on Tuesday. Approximately 725,000 illegal immigrants from India live in the US, making it the third-largest population of unauthorised immigrants after Mexico and El Salvador, according to data from the Pew Research Centre. Many people from Punjab, who are now facing deportation, had entered the US through the “donkey route” or other illegal means by spending lakhs of rupees. The US administration has launched a crackdown against illegal immigrants after Trump became the President. (With inputs from syndicated feed)",ahmedabad
"BJP leader criticises ‘current state’ of Gujarat, ‘This is not BJP culture’",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/bjp-leader-criticises-current-state-of-gujarat-this-is-not-bjp-culture,2025-02-06,6,02,2025,"Hemaben Acharya, a veteran BJP leader, has expressed disappointment at the current policies and political tactics of the ruling party – BJP. Amid the upcoming municipal and local body elections in Gujarat, Hemaben Acharya, a staunch supporter of the Jan Sangh and former Health minister in Government of Gujarat from 1975 to 1980, has expressed her anguish over BJP securing unopposed victories, thereby depriving people of their right to vote. She has strongly criticised today’s ‘BJP culture’, stating that if this situation continues, democracy is heading toward an emergency-like state. Her remarks have caused a political upheaval within the BJP. “This is not BJP’s culture” At 92 years old, former health minister and Jan Sangh veteran, Acharya stated, “This is not BJP’s culture at all, and this is not the BJP we built. Today’s BJP is going against its own principles.” Acharya and her husband, Suryakant Acharya, laid the foundation of BJP in Gujarat. Many prominent leaders, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, stayed at their residence, and they played a crucial role in establishing the Jan Sangh and BJP. She is particularly displeased with BJP’s strategy of bringing leaders from other parties into its fold. BJP has lost its core values Expressing her discontent, Hemaben remarked, “Defectors should be immediately suspended by the Election Commission, and a permanent ban should be imposed on them. Chimanbhai Shukla, a BJP pioneer in Rajkot Municipal Corporation, protested against party-switching for days, which had a significant impact. BJP has lost its core values, and there is nothing left to say about today’s BJP. People like us are left suffering in silence.” Moving toward emergency Speaking further about BJP, said, “Earlier in BJP, the principle was ‘not me, but you.’ I remember an incident in 1975 when three ministers in the Janata Morcha government said, ‘Give it to them, not me.’ But today, the situation has changed—everyone wants everything for themselves. If people don’t wake up now, the coming days will be disastrous. The public must intervene and select candidates wisely. Even if a good candidate has a minor flaw, that’s acceptable, but there should be no uncontested victories. In a democracy, voters are the rulers, and they must have their rights"". ""Unfortunately, today’s candidates prioritise their personal gains over public welfare. I remember the Emergency period, and the current circumstances are eerily similar. We are moving from democracy toward an emergency. The essence of democracy is being destroyed. Instead of bringing genuine reforms, true democracy is about solving people’s problems, not just implementing uniform policies.” Women are not safe in Gujarat The political atmosphere in Gujarat has heated up following Acharya's sharp criticism of her own party. Acharya, whom Narendra Modi has regarded as a mother figure, has voiced her concerns about the insecurity of daughters in Gujarat. Expressing her anguish over incidents like the Payal Goti case and the atrocities against Adivasi women in Dahod, she stated, “We never imagined such a Gujarat. Atrocities against daughters are increasing, and politics is being played over their suffering.” Expressing her outrage, she added, “Despite all the talks of women empowerment, women are not safe. Women and young girls are being exploited in politics, which is a very serious issue.” Speaking about the Payal Goti case, Acharya said, “A daughter became a victim due to the sins and internal conflicts of political leaders. Imagine her mental state and the pain of her parents. If I were her mother, I would have taken the law into my own hands, regardless of the consequences. When any daughter in society suffers, the entire community must rise above caste and unite to raise their voice. In the current scenario, neither sons nor daughters are safe at home or on the streets. Every day, new criminal gangs are emerging in Gujarat.” “I never imagined this Gujarat” Expressing her grief over Gujarat’s current state, Acharya said, “I never imagined a Gujarat or a country like this, where fake officials, fake leaders, and even fake courts exist. Seeing all this in today’s situation is heartbreaking. Leaders have no control over the system, and if they do, they lack the willpower to act. Instead of competing in elections, political parties are engaged in internal conflicts. Rather than making new laws, the existing ones should be implemented properly. When legislators and parliamentarians themselves turn into criminals, how can we expect good laws from them?” “People are now powerful only in name” She concluded by saying, “People are only ‘supreme’ in name. Their voice and rights should matter for them to be truly supreme. However, people are not opposing such policies because they are struggling to make ends meet. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are becoming poorer, creating a dangerous divide between them, which is a serious concern for the future.”",ahmedabad
Live streaming of court proceedings: Gujarat High Court warns of misuse,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/live-streaming-of-court-proceedings-gujarat-high-court-warns-of-misuse,2025-02-06,6,02,2025,"The Gujarat High Court has issued an opinion on the misuse of live-streamed court proceedings. The bench, led by Justice A S Supehia and Justice Gita Gopi, stated that live-streamed videos of court proceedings must be removed from platforms like YouTube after a specific period. However, the court acknowledged that the authority to make such decisions lies with the Chief Justice, leaving the matter to their discretion. The court has directed the registry to inform the Chief Justice accordingly. The ruling came after the Gujarat High Court rejected a contempt petition filed by ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, its officials, and their lawyers. The petition was dismissed with serious remarks about the petitioner’s conduct. The Gujarat Operational Creditors Association (GOCA) and its lawyer, Deepak Khosla, were found to have filed the petition with malicious intent, aiming to tarnish the reputation of the judges and opposing lawyers. The bench imposed a ₹2 lakh fine on the petitioner and strongly condemned the misuse of contempt law. In an important observation, the bench criticised the use of live-streamed videos as evidence. The petitioner had relied on a 259-page transcript of the court’s live-streamed proceedings, which was deemed improper. The court clarified that the Court Proceedings Live Streaming Rules-2021, Rule-5 does not authorise such videos as admissible evidence or part of the court record. This ruling serves as a stern warning against the abuse of legal tools and emphasises the need to respect judicial processes in the era of digital court proceedings.

The Gujarat government, in coordination with the police department, had made arrangements to escort them to their respective homes. One-way ticket worth ₹60 lakh Reports suggest that the cost of travelling illegally from Gujarat to the US via the infamous ‘Donkey Route’ has remained at ₹60 lakh for the past five years. All the data of these deported individuals, who spent such a hefty amount, has been handed over to Indian security agencies by US security agencies. Currently, it is unclear whether the Indian government will take strict action against them. However, most of these individuals had taken loans to reach the US, crossing borders at great risk. Since Trump took office and implemented strict policies against illegal migration, agents operating in areas such as Kadi-Kalol, Anand, and Bharuch in Gujarat have come under significant scrutiny. Mehsana’s dollar dreams In Mehsana district, the villages of Kherva, Jorarnang, and Meu are commonly known as ‘dolariyo vistar’ (dollar region) due to the large number of people from these villages who have settled abroad over the years. Following the recent crackdown by US authorities, the deportation of illegal immigrants has brought this region into the spotlight. Reports indicate that 104 individuals were apprehended from New Jersey, New York, California, Texas, and Illinois. Certain villages in Kadi-Kalol are known to send family members to America illegally every year. In some families, arrangements were made in early adolescence, with relatives in the US sending money to help them settle illegally. A total of 32 people from various villages in north Gujarat’s Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Patan, and Banaskantha districts have been deported. These villages include Jornang, Vasai, Dabhala, Chandranagar, Kherva, Meu, Khanusa, Dabhada, Valam, Deesa, Siddhpur, Boru, Vadasma, Mansa, Manund, Indrapura, and several others. Among those caught illegally entering the US and subsequently deported, 9 are from Mehsana district, 14 from Gandhinagar, 4 from Patan, and 1 from Banaskantha. Authorities have released a list of these individuals. Who are the deportees Among the recently deported individuals, are a woman from Meu and a girl from Kherva, who had left for the US just seven months ago. Attempts were made to speak with their families and villagers, but they refused to comment. Smit Patel, originally from Mansa in Gandhinagar but currently residing near Manjipura, Nadiad, was among those deported from the US. However, his family has chosen to remain silent on the matter. Moreover, Shivani Goswami (27) from Petlad, Anand, was also among those deported, but her family has reportedly moved out of Petlad. Woman deported only after 25 days in US Relatives of 27-year-old Khushbu Patel from Luna village of Padra taluka stated that they, too, learned about her deportation from the media. However, they are unaware of the reasons behind her deportation and will only find out once she returns. Her relatives mentioned that Khushbu got married to a man from Ahmedabad eight months ago. She had recently travelled to the US and had only been there for 25 days before she was deported. They are unaware why she was deported, but are worried what will happen next. She had gone to the US for a bright future, but since she has returned, they will welcome her back. Notably, Khushbu’s father, Jayanti Patel, is a farmer. As per reports, she studied up to the 12th grade and lived in the Atladara area of Vadodara for some time. Reports indicate that Khushbu, along with a woman from Ankleshwar, arrived in Ahmedabad from Amritsar on Thursday morning.

The case has been registered at Sola High Court police station, and an investigation is underway. The complainant, Sarojben Yadav, who lives in Gota, stated that she had known the accused, Geetaben, for over a decade, having met her during her visits to Delhi. Over the years, they had maintained a cordial relationship. As per Sarojben’s complaint, on February 17, 2019, Geetaben visited her residence in Ahmedabad and invited her for a shopping trip. Sarojben declined, stating that she had other commitments. The complainant left Geetaben alone in the house for about an hour. The following day, upon checking her bedroom, Sarojben found that her gold and real diamond bangles (18 carats) worth ₹79,167 and a diamond finger ring (18 carats) worth ₹13,470 were missing from a drawer. After an extensive search, she was unable to locate the jewellery but was not able to confront her friend regarding the matter. Later, while visiting Delhi, she noticed Geethaben’s daughter wearing the same ring. Upon confrontation, the accused allegedly claimed that the ring was purchased from Karol Bagh. Sarojben then checked with the jeweller and discovered that Geetaben had exchanged the stolen bangles and ring for a new gold necklace and another ring on August 7, 2020. As per the police, due to frequent travel and personal commitments, Sarojben could not file a complaint earlier. However, upon finding time, she has now approached the police, seeking legal action against Geetaben. Following her complaint, the police have registered the case and initiated an inquiry. The accused will face charges of theft and criminal breach of trust under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.

The complainant, identified as Maroonam Gypsy, lives in Goyal Intercity, Thaltej, and works as an associate in the HR department of St Xavier’s College. She has accused her husband Jojo George and Mayur Bhanubhai Upadhyay, a director at Pramay Advisory Services Pvt Ltd, of orchestrating the fraud without her knowledge. Forgery and fraud According to the complaint, between September 18, 2019 and November 7, 2019, Jojo George and Upadhyay allegedly forged Gypsy’s signatures on multiple financial documents to secure a mortgage loan of ₹25 lakh from IDFC First Bank. The documents were then presented as genuine to the bank and the Sub-Registrar’s office in Ahmedabad (Bopal). Gypsy claims she only discovered the loan on April 19, 2021 when representatives from IDFC First Bank arrived at her residence, informing her that the property was at risk of foreclosure due to non-payment of loan instalments. Upon confronting her husband, George allegedly admitted to taking the loan but refused to provide any documents. Following this revelation, Gypsy approached IDFC First Bank to request loan documentation, which was denied. Despite her efforts, the bank proceeded with recovery proceedings. Legal action initiated After learning of further financial discrepancies—including a gold loan taken against jewellery from their joint locker—Gypsy sought legal assistance. A formal notice was sent to IDFC First Bank on January 4, 2022, challenging the legitimacy of the mortgage loan. On August 28, 2024, Gypsy returned home from work to find a possession notice from IDFC affixed to her residence, notifying her that the bank would seize the property due to non-payment of the loan. She then filed a complaint at Vastrapur police station, seeking legal recourse against her husband and the financial agent. Probe underway Vastrapur police have registered the case and launched an investigation under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code related to fraud, forgery, and financial misrepresentation. Authorities have confirmed that the alleged forgery involved notarised documents, including a general power of attorney and mortgage agreements, which were submitted without Gypsy’s consent.",ahmedabad
Gujarat GST Dept uncovers ₹2.55 crore tax evasion in pan masala trade,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-gst-dept-uncovers-rs-2-55-crore-tax-evasion-in-pan-masala-trade,2025-02-07,7,02,2025,"Gujarat State GST Department intercepted six vehicles transporting unaccounted pan masala and tobacco pouches in the Ahmedabad district on February 4, following it up with an investigation. The raids, based on specific intelligence, led to the detection of 42.12 lakh unaccounted pouches, with an estimated GST evasion of over ₹2.55 crore, officials informed on Thursday. The department’s efforts targeted the illegal movement of sensitive commodities, particularly goods transported without invoices, with faulty invoices, or with improper documentation. Upon physical verification, officials uncovered a significant quantity of undeclared goods, reinforcing concerns over large-scale tax evasion in the pan masala and tobacco trade. Legal proceedings are now underway to recover government revenue and penalise those responsible. Between the financial years 2021-22 and 2024-25 (up to October 31, 2024), central tax officers in Gujarat registered 12,803 cases of Goods and Services Tax (GST) evasion, leading to the arrest of 101 individuals under Section 69 of the CGST Act, 2017. The state has witnessed a significant increase in GST evasion during this period. In the first seven months of FY 2024-25 alone (April to October 2024), evasion amounted to ₹12,066.8 crore, surpassing the ₹10,109.7 crore recorded in the entire FY 2023-24. This marks a 515% rise compared to the ₹1,959.74 crore evasion reported in FY 2019-20. Despite these figures, recovery of the evaded taxes remains a challenge. Over the past four and a half years, only about 24% (approximately ₹9,557.22 crore) of the total evaded amount has been recovered. Authorities attribute the rise in detected evasion cases to improved detection methods, policy amendments, and enhanced surveillance systems. Initiatives such as data analytics to monitor return filing patterns and the implementation of biometric verification linked to Aadhaar authentication for GST registrations are being employed to curb evasion.

The estimated loss amounts to approximately ₹1.7 crore. Incident Details According to the complaint filed at Navrangpura Police Station, Soni discovered discrepancies in his accounts on February 8, 2025. While reconciling transactions, he noticed that a delivery of 500 grams of gold was falsely recorded under a trader’s account without any corresponding payment received in the company’s bank records.

Ahmedabad west youth falling prey to east’s drug syndicate?,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-west-youth-falling-prey-to-easts-drug-syndicate,2025-02-10,10,02,2025,"International drug cartels have reportedly made Gujarat a hub for drug trafficking as in the past five years youngsters in the western part of Ahmedabad have been targeted for drug addiction. Meanwhile, drug trafficking networks are being operated from the eastern region. The drug network is set up by offering free doses of drugs to the youth a few times, creating an addiction, and then using them to establish the trafficking network. The increase in drug use among the youth in Ahmedabad is alarming, prompting the Special Operations Group (SOG) to take actions that were never undertaken in the past decade, achieving significant results in the last three years. Over ten years, there were only 35 drug-related cases, but in just three years, the SOG has registered 109 cases and arrested 238 people involved in the drug business, seizing narcotics worth ₹5.63 crore, with ₹5.16 crore worth of MD drugs alone. Ahmedabad’s youth are systematically being drawn into the world of drugs and addiction. Those involved in the drug trade target students and young adults, initially offering free drugs to get them addicted, after which they involve them in the network of drug sales. The majority of the arrested drug peddlers are from the eastern part of the city, as per reports. The drug trade, however, is prevalent in affluent areas in western Ahmedabad, such as Sindhu Bhavan Road, Satellite, Navrangpura, Naranpura, and other areas that house educational institutions and affluent families. On December 31, 2022, the SOG arrested Irfan Sethi from Banaskantha and Niyamat Khan Alikhan Nagori on Sindhu Bhavan Road, Ahmedabad, with 296.78 grams of Mephedrone worth ₹29,67,800. In total, 58 cases of Mephedrone have been registered, leading to the seizure of ₹5.16 crore worth of drugs. The police have devised a strategy to root out drug trafficking and break the larger synthetic drug network by using informants and setting traps to catch drug dealers and peddlers. As part of this effort, the SOG has formed a dedicated team to break the drug cartel network. According to Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Jayraj Singh Vala of Ahmedabad’s SOG Crime Branch, a dedicated team has been set up to dismantle the drug network. The team continues to monitor the situation and take action to stop the street-level drug sales. In Ahmedabad, wealthy individuals and young people are involved in the ‘party culture’, where they consume MD drugs, heroin, opium, and hashish. Many of them snort the drugs mixed with pan masala or inject them, which has raised concerns. Moreover, drug peddlers are creating a network by involving youth who are initially offered free drugs but later forced into selling them. Many of these young individuals are unable to afford expensive drugs, so they dilute the drugs with chemicals and sell them at lower prices. The police are also facing difficulties as many accused individuals, after being released on bail, return to the drug trade. One shocking case involved a woman from Dariyapur, who, after serving a 10-year sentence for drug trafficking, resumed her involvement in the business and was caught with 31.310 grams of Mephedrone worth ₹3,13,100. This growing issue of drug trafficking is concerning for both the police and society, as it continues to affect the youth and communities in Ahmedabad.",ahmedabad

The state health department has launched an extensive campaign to ensure compliance, with a deadline set for March 12. Institutions failing to register within the given time frame could face penalties of up to ₹5 lakh. As part of this regulation, all medical practitioners and healthcare professionals running clinics must also register. An official said that the directive applies to allopathy, ayurveda, homoeopathy, and Unani medical institutions providing healthcare services. As per the official data, as of Tuesday a total of 16,698 healthcare facilities across Gujarat have completed either permanent or provisional registration. Of these, 14,647 institutions have completed online registration, including 1,882 government and 5,268 private healthcare centres. The registered facilities include 12,028 allopathy hospitals, 1,622 ayurveda centres, and over 3,000 homoeopathy hospitals and clinics. Additionally, 566 clinical laboratories, 28 dialysis centres, and various physiotherapy and dental clinics have been registered under the act. The government aims to streamline healthcare operations, enhance service quality, and ensure accountability within the sector. With the approaching deadline, the Health Department urges all unregistered medical facilities to comply with the new regulation to avoid penalties and ensure uninterrupted operations. The state now boasts 319 Community Health Centers (CHCs), 1,463 Primary Health Centers (PHCs), and 6,575 sub-centers, reflecting a 41% increase in PHCs and a 37% rise in CHCs since 2001-02. Additionally, the number of medical colleges has grown from nine in 2001 to over 30 in 2023. The Gujarat Hospital Management Information System (GHMIS) reports that 35 hospitals are currently operational under its purview, with 17 being teaching hospitals. Collectively, these institutions have recorded over 91 million outpatient registrations and approximately 9 million inpatient registrations. Despite these advancements, challenges persist. Healthcare services for the tribal populations in Gujarat remain inadequate, with reports of systematic exploitation by both legitimate and illegitimate practitioners. Furthermore, disparities in maternal health services are evident across districts. For instance, the percentage of women receiving four or more antenatal care visits ranges from 56% in Banaskantha to 95% in Navsari.

Typically available after Holi, varieties such as Badam, Sundari, Totapuri, and Hapus (Alphonso) are now being sold in the Naroda fruit market, with daily supplies ranging from 500 to 1,000 kilos. Experts attribute this unusual phenomenon to climate change. The rising temperatures have led to an early end to winter, directly ushering in summer-like conditions. As a result, mango crops in states like Kerala have ripened sooner than usual. Naroda fruit vendors revealed, “This year, mangoes have arrived nearly a month early. Varieties like Alphonso, Sundari, and Totapuri are being sourced from Kerala, where the summer heat has already led to the mango harvest.” Due to limited supply, wholesale mango prices are currently in the range of ₹150 to ₹500 per kilo. The high prices have dampened retail demand, with only around 10% of buyers making purchases. However, the onset of warmer days and demand from juice centres and wedding caterers have driven steady sales.

In 2014, a trial court had sentenced Dhaval Trivedi, a 52-year-old teacher, to life imprisonment under the POCSO Act for raping a minor in Rajkot. After getting parole from this sentence, he came out of jail and started English tuition in Chotila where he trapped a young woman by professing love. In August 2018, he eloped with her. After a habeas corpus was filed by the girl’s father in Gujarat High Court, the high court handed over the case to the CBI. As per reports, after absconding, Trivedi was running a medical store in Gaidi near Haridwar under a false identity. In March 2020, after a fight with the young woman, she revealed Trivedi’s true identity to the landlord, causing him to flee. CBI finally arrested him in 2020 after receiving leads about Trivedi from the young woman. The court noted that the crime against the accused has been proven. Such a crime cannot be taken lightly. Special Advocate Varun Trivedi, presented 27 witnesses and 69 documents, proving the case against the accused, stating that the accused had previously been convicted in a rape case in Rajkot. It was proved that after obtaining parole from Rajkot, he trapped a young woman from Chotila, raped her, and impregnated her. Womaniser and serial offender Dhaval Trivedi of Vadodara, after completing higher studies, married a girl from Mumbai in 2003. However, his wife passed away just six months into their marriage. Returning to Vadodara from Mumbai, Dhaval ensnared a girl from Punjab at Maharaja Sayajirao University in his web of deceit. Claiming to be a Punjabi himself, he married her. After that, he trapped another girl and married her in Anand through Arya Samaj rituals. The girl from Chotila was his ninth victim.  Dhaval Trivedi had deceived nine girls and ruined their lives, but was in search of another girl to trap, intending to later write a book titled ‘Ten Perfect Women in My Life’.

Land laws dating back to 1979 were manipulated to prevent the land from being taken over by the government. The accused allegedly misappropriated 17,705 sqm of land and initiated construction, leading to a ₹500 crore fraud. Manoj Tejumal Khanna, a resident of Usmanpura, filed a complaint with CID Crime, Ahmedabad Zone, against Rajan Shah (of Palm Swing Realty LLP), Suketu Shah (resident of Aryaman Bungalows, Thaltej), Rishil Shah, and Yogesh Bhatt (resident of Narayan Complex, Navrangpura). Background to the land fraud The disputed land in survey number 451 of Vadaj village was originally owned by Chhanalal Keshavlal Prajapati, who had given it to Punja Prajapati for brick manufacturing. However, Punja allegedly forged Chhanalal’s signatures and transferred the land to Mehra Bharwad, whose heirs were later listed as the owners. To prevent the land from being seized under the Land Ceiling Act, Mehra entered a development agreement with Ashok Vatika Co-op Housing Society in 1979. In 1995, Manoj purchased the land from Chhanalal’s son, Ishwar, for ₹31.50 lakh, but the sale deed was not registered due to municipal housing reservations. That same year, Mehra and his associates allegedly attacked Manoj but no complaint was filed. Despite having possession of the land, the names of Mehra’s heirs, including Chinu, were fraudulently entered into official records. Chinu later sold the land to Ashok Vatika Co-op Housing Society. In 2006, Manoj filed a case in Bhadra City Civil Court, which is still ongoing. In 2010, the office bearers of Ashok Vatika Co-op Housing Society and Palm Spring Realty Pvt Ltd settled the dispute internally, transferring ownership to Yogesh Bhatt. Manoj sought legal intervention to cancel this document. Later, in 2013 and 2018, attempts were made to clear the land title, which Manoj opposed. In 2019, Rajan, Suketu, Rishil, and Yogesh allegedly provided false information to authorities and manipulated land records. Using fraudulent methods, they cancelled the lis pendens (legal notice preventing transactions on disputed property), leading to government clearance. They then launched a housing project named ‘Palm Paradise’. A complaint was filed with the RERA office in Gandhinagar, and after an investigation, RERA officials revoked approvals and advised filing a police complaint. Manojbhai has now filed a complaint with CID Crime, citing fraudulent land transactions and government office manipulation. Fraud in Vastrapur A case has been registered in Vastrapur for a ₹55 lakh fraud involving office space documents. Krunal Jogadiya of Bhavnagar filed a complaint against Dhanesh Jain, Amit Vakil, and Paritosh Patel. The accused allegedly sold office spaces (Units 507 and 508) in Alpha Business Park and took ₹55.50 lakh, but never provided the sale documents. Vastrapur police have begun an investigation. A case has been registered in Bodakdev regarding fraudulent land documents. Pankhil Parikh of Ambawadi filed a complaint against Govind and Vipul Shah. They allegedly forged documents to claim ownership of a 1,453-square-metre plot using false seals and signatures under RKC Realty LLP. Bodakdev police have started an investigation into this land scam. Also read: Dumas land scam accused extends leave, action delayed",ahmedabad
"Ahmedabad PRL scientists discover new alien planet, 263 times larger than Earth",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-prl-scientists-discover-new-alien-planet-263-times-larger-than-earth,2025-02-13,13,02,2025,"Ahmedabad-based scientists at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) have made a groundbreaking discovery. They have found a massive alien planet outside our solar system, named TOI-6038A b, as per reports. This planet is so large that it can accommodate 263 Earths within it. The discovery was made by PRL scientists using a telescope at an observatory in Mount Abu. Features of new planet - Size: The mass of this planet is 78.5 times that of Earth, and its radius is 6.41 times larger than Earth’s. - Orbit: The planet orbits a bright, metal-rich F-type star every 5.83 days in a circular orbit. The star it orbits is hotter and more luminous than the Sun. - Binary system: The planet exists in a binary star system which means it has two stars in its system. It orbits one of the stars, while the second star is positioned a little farther away. - Planet type: The TOI-6038A b lies in the transition region between Neptune-like and gas giant exoplanets, called as “Sub-Saturn,” a category absent in our solar system, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution. The scientists used a high-tech telescope known as PARAS-2 to discover this planet. This instrument is capable of detecting minute movements of stars. According to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) document, TOI-6038A b likely has a massive rocky core making up about 75% of its mass, with the rest being a hydrogen-helium envelope. This helps scientists understand the transition between rocky planets and gas giants. Its brightness makes it ideal for studying its atmosphere and orbit, which could improve theories on how exoplanets move. Searching for hidden companion planets may also reveal more about its evolution. Scientists are excited to conduct further studies on TOI-6038A b. Due to its brightness, more research can be carried out in the future. India is progressing rapidly in space research and is eager to discover new planets. This planet is classified as a sub-Saturn, meaning it is smaller than Saturn. Studying such sub-Saturn planets is crucial, as our solar system does not contain such planets, making this an evolutionary research breakthrough. “This highlights India’s growing expertise in advanced astronomical instrumentation, with the PARAS-2 spectrograph being the highest-resolution stabilized radial velocity (RV) spectrograph in Asia,” said ISRO.",ahmedabad
Ahmedabad: A city born out of love?,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/teja-and-ahmad-shah-the-love-story-behind-ahmedabads-legendary-foundation,2025-02-13,13,02,2025,"As February unfolds—a month that celebrates both Ahmedabad’s foundation and the spirit of love—there’s a cherished folklore that continues to weave its magic in the hearts of Amdavadis. Beyond the World Heritage City and bustling pols, many stories have been passed on since the city’s birth in 1411. Legend has it that Ahmedabad’s founder Sultan Ahmad Shah fell in love with Teja, the daughter of Bhil Maharaja Aasha Bhil, ruler of Ashaval, an area on the east of river Sabarmati. Aasha Bhil ruled Astodia Darwaza (the present Dhal-ni-pol area) and was known as ‘Asha Bhil-no-Tekro’. In 1411, Sultan Ahmad Shah’s decision to establish Ahmedabad stemmed from his love for Teja. Myth suggests that Ahmad Shah was mesmerised by Teja and he regularly visited Ashaval from Patan. Before the Sultan could attack a small habitat of Ashaval, Teja’s father married her daughter to the Shah, even if initially he had reservations. Now that Shah finally got his Begum, Teja, he shifted her to Patan, the then capital of Gujarat. However, Teja missed her parents’ home.  She spoke highly of the land near her father’s home and urged the Sultan to visit. Intrigued, he decided to explore the area and went hunting in the forests along the Sabarmati River. During the hunt, a hare unexpectedly emerged from the bushes, fiercely driving away his hunting dogs. Astonished by the hare’s bravery, the sultan reasoned that if such small creatures were so fearless, the people of this land must be even more remarkable. Inspired by this incident, he chose to establish a city in the same spot and made it his capital. Thus, in 1411, Ahmedabad—the city of Ahmed—was founded. This legend is captured in a local Gujarati couplet: Jab kutte par sassa aaya, tab badshah ne shaher basaaya (When the hound was overpowered by the hare, the king established a city there) This suggests that the main character behind the city’s foundation remains Teja, the queen of the Sultan who later shifted his capital from Patan to Ahmedabad. However, historians and experts differ in their validation of  the story and have dubbed it a myth. “Ashawal’s existence is traced to the 11th century, while Sultan founded the city in the 15th century, and Teja’s mention with Ahmad Shah is nowhere recorded in the books,” says Dr Manek Patel, author of books ‘Amdavad-Katha’ and ‘Aa Chhe Amdavad’. He says that Amdavadis have always been obsessed with telling and listening to stories, so Teja and Ahmad Shah’s love story is one of them.",ahmedabad

The gang allegedly provided these accounts to Chinese cybercriminals, facilitating large-scale financial scams across multiple states, including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. Following intelligence reports, a raid was conducted at House No. C-705, Pashva Residency, Chandkheda, Ahmedabad, where several individuals were found involved in cyber fraud. Upon questioning, one of them, Suresh Jagdish Bishnoi, identified himself as the leader, revealing that all others were from Jodhpur, Rajasthan. During interrogation, it was discovered that these individuals had been opening multiple bank accounts using fraudulent Aadhaar cards in Ahmedabad and were handing over all banking materials—passbooks, chequebooks, and ATM cards—to Bishnoi. These materials were then sent to Sunil Virani, the mastermind operating from Jodhpur. Further scrutiny of the Aadhaar cards revealed six instances of manipulated addresses, where the original data had been altered using OTP verification. The seized items include: - 12 mobile phones - 20 Aadhaar cards (including 10 duplicates) - 10 PAN cards - 21 chequebooks - 10 bank passbooks - 43 ATM/debit cards - 15 SIM cards - One pistol with seven live cartridges (found in the possession of accused Sahiram Bishnoi) Following this revelation, a case was registered at the Cyber Crime Police Station, and further investigations commenced under sections of the IT Act and IPC related to fraud, identity theft, and illegal possession of firearms. Frauds across country Technical analysis of the seized mobile phones and further interrogation revealed that 109 complaints had been filed against this gang in the NCRP (National Cybercrime Reporting Portal) across 21 states, including four complaints in Gujarat alone. The gang had managed to open fraudulent bank accounts in 26 branches across different cities. Modus operandi The gang operated by exploiting Aadhaar-based OTP verification to modify addresses and then opened bank accounts under false identities. These accounts were then used for: - Task fraud (job fraud, investment fraud, and digital fraud transactions) - Layering and laundering money through multiple accounts - Withdrawing large sums through IMPS and other online banking methods before detection They ensured that the money was quickly moved out of the banking system to avoid detection. More arrests A special police team was dispatched to Jodhpur, Rajasthan, where additional arrests were made, including key accuseds Lalit Bibhoi and Kuldeep Panamaram Kichar. The arrested individuals from Ahmedabad and Rajasthan include: 1. Suresh Jagdish Bishnoi (19), Jodhpur, Rajasthan 2. Anil Ugrasen Bishnoi (20), Bikaner, Rajasthan 3.

GU Animation Department scam: Knowledge partners were  allegedly overpaid ₹3 crore,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gu-animation-department-knowledge-partners-were-allegedly-overpaid-rs-3-crore,2025-02-13,13,02,2025,"The Ahmedabad Crime Branch is currently investigating Gujarat University’s infamous animation scam involving former coordinator Kamaljit Lakhtariya. According to details from the university’s judicial and departmental investigation report, the Animation Department generated a total fee revenue of over ₹24.25 crore from self-financed courses and programmes between 2017-18 and 2021-22. From this amount, over ₹17.65 crore was paid to knowledge partners and agencies running these courses. The investigation revealed that more than ₹3 crore was paid to these knowledge partners fraudulently. As per the MoU between the Animation Department and knowledge partners, Gujarat University was to receive 40% of the total revenue from 2017-18 to 2020-21, while the knowledge partners would receive 60%. For 2021-22, the university’s share was set at 30.70%. In July 2023, after a new vice-chancellor took charge, suspicion arose regarding irregularities in the Animation Department. Consequently, on August 8, 2023, Dr Kamaljit Lakhtariya, Associate Professor at GU was removed from his position, and all financial transaction documents, including cheque books, were seized from him. Later, in October 2023, the vice-chancellor assigned the chief accountant to investigate the matter. The judicial inquiry report includes findings from the chief accountant’s internal investigation, which states that the total revenue generated from private courses and programmes over five years (2017-18 to 2021-22) was ₹24,25,68,150. Of this, the university received ₹3,17,85,750, while knowledge partners were paid ₹17,75,12,336. Following the university accountant’s initial investigation, an external Chartered Accountant was hired in December 2023 for further scrutiny. The audit examined transactions in eight bank accounts—seven in private banks and one in a government bank—related to the Animation Department. This investigation confirmed that payments were not made as per the MoU terms, meaning the university received less than its due share, while knowledge partners were overpaid. Based on the audit, the Executive Council (EC) passed a resolution on July 16, 2024, suspending Lakhtariya from his academic duties and initiating a departmental inquiry. As per the charge sheet, the university received ₹6,52,41,510 less than the agreed 40% share, ₹4,09,74,695 less than the 30% share, and ₹1,67,27,880 less than the 20% share. Between 2017 and 2021, the university suffered a shortfall of ₹3.27 crore. Despite multiple investigations, it remains unclear whether the university actually lost over ₹6 crore or ₹3 crore, and the exact amount overpaid to knowledge partners is also undetermined. As a result, the scam remains a significant mystery, and the Crime Branch investigation is ongoing. ₹1.64 crore transferred to traders’ accounts The charge sheet further alleges that ₹1,64,69,950 was transferred to traders’ accounts without any supporting documents. In response to a legal notice,  professor Lakhtariya reportedly submitted all necessary records and evidence.

According to fire officials, the incident occurred around 8.30 am on the first floor of a duplex house opposite Sumil Park. Upon receiving the distress call, a fire brigade unit, comprising one firefighter and a team of six officials, was dispatched to the scene. It took the team nearly an hour to bring the situation under control. While no casualties were reported, the fire caused significant damage to furniture and electronic appliances inside the house. A senior fire official stated that preliminary investigations suggest the fire originated from a wooden stove (chulha) on the balcony. The house owner was reportedly boiling water when the flames spread to other parts of the house. Fortunately, the fire was controlled by the fire team, before it could spread further inside the house and damage other valuables. The owner’s carelessness was the reason behind the fire, as the balcony was no place to use a wooden stove. Authorities have urged residents to exercise caution while using open flames inside residential premises to prevent such incidents.

Gujarat University animation scam: Former department head illegally drew over ₹42 lakh in salary,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-university-animation-former-department-head-illegally-drew-over-rs-42-lakh-in-salary,2025-02-14,14,02,2025,"More and more details of the scam at the animation department of Gujarat University are emerging as the inquiry progresses. Kamaljit Lakhtariya, the former head of the department has been found to have transferred more than ₹1.15 crore to a joint account with his wife, as per the judicial inquiry report. However, he returned only ₹67.32 lakh to the university, leaving ₹48,23,025 unaccounted for. Additionally, the report states that he wrongfully received a salary of over ₹42 lakh. Based on the findings of the judicial inquiry, the university had decided to terminate his employment as a faculty member. Findings of inquiry report As per the judicial inquiry report, Lakhtariya transferred over ₹1.15 crore to his wife’s account but returned only ₹67.32 lakh to the university. Thus, ₹48,23,025 remains unaccounted for. The report also highlights inconsistencies in his responses—his reply to the first notice and the response in the charge sheet differed. Initially, he claimed that his name was listed first in the joint account with his wife, and the money was transferred inadvertently but later returned. However, in another response, he stated that the money was taken to provide advance payments to vendors. These contradictory statements raised further concerns. From the total transferred amount of over ₹1.15 crore, only ₹67,32,028 could be verified through submitted vouchers and slips, leaving the rest unexplained. Although he was issued three notices by the university, he maintained that there was no financial misconduct or fraud, asserting that all transactions were approved by the authorities. The report further revealed that Kamaljit Lakhtariya received an excess salary of ₹42.88 lakh over three years. Lakhtariya was appointed as an associate professor on probation in the computer science department at GU. Following a resolution by the executive council and an order from the vice-chancellor, he was made permanent on June 26, 2017. However, before that, on December 29, 2015, he was appointed as the in-charge coordinator of the Animation Department. In addition to his associate professor’s salary, he was also granted an additional monthly honorarium of ₹15,000, which was later increased to ₹30,000. However, the inquiry report details salary irregularities. In 2021, instead of receiving ₹3.60 lakh annually at the rate of ₹30,000 per month, he received ₹4.22 lakh. In 2022, he received ₹12,74,939 instead of ₹3.60 lakh, and in 2023, he took ₹36,71,895 instead of ₹3.60 lakh. This resulted in an excess salary of ₹42.88 lakh. In his defence, Lakhtariya claimed that all honorarium payments were made with the approval of the university authorities and that the excess funds were utilised for minor expenses, purchases, and infrastructure development.",ahmedabad

"46% of Gujarat's children deprived of cancer treatment, over 3,600 new cases annually",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/46-percent-of-gujarats-children-deprived-of-cancer-treatment-over-3600-new-cases-annually,2025-02-15,15,02,2025,"Gujarat reports an average of over 71,500 new cancer cases annually, with a worrying rise in childhood cancer cases. Every year, approximately 3,600 children in the state are diagnosed with cancer. The World Health Organisation (WHO) observes International Childhood Cancer Day on February 15 each year to raise awareness about the disease. According to national statistics, India records around 76,800 new childhood cancer cases annually. Data from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) reveals that among cancer cases registered up to the age of 19, 60% are boys and 40% are girls. The most common types of cancer among children include blood cancer, brain tumors, leukaemia, and lymphoma. A major concern is that 46% of children in Gujarat do not receive proper cancer treatment. Experts cite late diagnosis, lack of awareness, and limited resources as key reasons for this alarming situation. Doctors emphasise that parents must ensure their children receive the HPV vaccine as per medical recommendations. Moreover, parents should focus on strengthening their child's immune system from an early age. Experts warn that factors such as reduced physical activity, unhealthy eating habits, and environmental changes significantly impact children's health. Early detection and timely medical intervention can significantly improve survival rates, making awareness and preventive measures crucial in the fight against childhood cancer.",ahmedabad

The incident came to light when a missing person complaint was filed in Nikol police station by the family of 27-year-old Jayesh Vanzara after he disappeared on February 9 and never returned home. As per the investigation, it was revealed that ₹18 lakh had been credited to Vanzara’s account for a business deal he had facilitated. Upon learning about this transaction, his friends, Sachin Panchal and Vivek Khatri, hatched a plan to steal the money. They invited Vanzara for drinks at Narmada Canal Road in Gandhinagar, knowing his account details and password. On the evening of February 9, when Vanzara arrived at the location, they laced his drink with sedatives. After consuming the alcohol, he fell unconscious. Taking advantage of the situation, Khatri and Panchal transferred ₹5,500 from his account to their own. They then pushed Vanzara into the canal, abandoned his bike on a random road, and fled the scene. Following the missing complaint filed at Nikol police station, the police launched an investigation. Panchal and Khatri were apprehended, and during interrogation, they confessed to the crime. Also read : Hotel owner killed for refusing free ride in Ahmedabad, 3 history-sheeters arrested",ahmedabad

Gujarat HC Advocates demand transfer of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-hc-advocates-demands-transfer-of-chief-justice-sunita-agarwal,2025-02-17,17,02,2025,"The Gujarat High Court Advocates’ Association (GHCAA) on Monday resolved to seek transfer of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal to another High Court. Gujarat High Court has embroiled in a series of controversies. In a case where files went missing from the court, Justice Sandeep N Bhatt raised serious concerns about the controversial and suspicious conduct of A T Ukrani, Registrar (SCMS & ICT), who has been working in the High Court registry for the past six years. Following these critical observations, the sudden change in Justice Bhatt’s roster by the Chief Justice has sparked widespread discussions and strong resentment within Gujarat’s judicial system and the legal community. The abrupt reassignment of Justice Sandeep N Bhatt’s roster has also caused internal unrest among some of his fellow High Court judges and lawyers. In response, GHCAA had called for an urgent meeting on Monday. It is not the first time that Chief Justice Agarwal has suddenly changed a judge’s roster. Previously, she had unexpectedly reassigned the Contempt of Court roster from the bench led by Justice Umesh Trivedi. Similarly, the contempt petition hearings concerning stray cattle and deteriorating roads, which were being heard by the bench of Justice Sameer J Dave and Justice Alpesh Y Kogje, were also reassigned, transferring them to habeas corpus and other matters. At that time, this move had also triggered widespread discussions. Now, after Justice Bhatt’s critical remarks against Registrar Ukrani (who, during his tenure as Additional District Judge in Surat, was involved in the disappearance of 15 case files within seven months), Chief Justice Agarwal reassigned Justice Bhatt’s roster. He was moved from a single-judge bench and placed on a division bench alongside his senior, Justice Elesh J Vora. This has led to strong resentment and outrage among the legal fraternity. Senior advocate Asim Pandya, former president of the GHCAA, has written a letter to the current president, Brijesh Trivedi, demanding an urgent general body meeting to discuss this issue. As a result, the association has scheduled an emergency meeting tomorrow afternoon. In his letter, the former president made serious allegations, stating that this is the second instance in recent weeks where the Chief Justice has abruptly reassigned a judge’s roster. He questioned whether the association should tolerate such decisions or oppose them. He further emphasised that these two incidents have far-reaching consequences for citizens' fundamental rights, the rule of law, and judicial independence. He also posed a critical question – Although the Chief Justice is the master of the roster and has the authority over assignments, does suddenly changing a judge’s roster in this manner serve the interests of judicial independence and administrative justice? The former president of the association also urged lawyers to stand in support of judges who are being unfairly targeted for their observations during hearings or in written orders. He warned that if such treatment is tolerated, independent and impartial judges will be lost. He recalled a similar instance three years ago when the association successfully prevented the unjust transfer of an independent and impartial judge from Gujarat High Court to another High Court. He stressed that the association must protect such judges to uphold the rule of law and judicial independence at all costs.

Two Naroda families recount their journey to the US and back,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/two-naroda-families-recount-their-journey-to-the-us-and-back,2025-02-17,17,02,2025,"A family of four from Naroda who were deported from the United States have recounted their shattered dreams and journey to the US via France in an exclusive interview to Gujarat Samachar Digital . Hardik Dashrath Patel, his wife Swati Hardik Patel, son Henil and daughter Disha, residents of Tulsi Residency in Nava Naroda were among the 29 Gujaratis who arrived in the third flight from Amritsar to Ahmedabad on Monday afternoon. The Patels had left their home on January 2, 2025, with dreams of making a bright future in America. Upon arrival in the US via France where they flew in from India, they were kept in a camp with other Indians awaiting deportation. Swati Patel expressed distress over the lack of food options, stating, “We were only provided non-vegetarian food, which was difficult for many of us.” The Patel family revealed that several families were put up at a camp by the US authorities. Talking about the families at the camp, Swati Patel said, “They had endured extreme hardship as they walked for four days straight with their children in pursuit of their American dream. Some of their fellow travellers even attempted to reach the US through perilous ocean routes.” However, they had travelled by flight, she added. According to Swati, when they boarded the aircraft, they were unaware that they were being sent back to India. “We were not handcuffed by the US authorities, but we had no idea that we were being deported to India,” she said. About how they left abroad, the Patels told Gujarat Samachar Digital that the agent who facilitated their journey was one Mangaldas Patel from Mehsana. However, they didn’t mention how much they had spent on their journey. Their revelation sheds light on the illegal immigration network that continues to lure migrants with false promises. Another family from Naroda that was brought back from the US are Tushar Patel, his wife Chetana and their son Neet. Residents of Nilkanth Villa in Nava Naroda, they too had arrived on the flight from Amritsar on Monday afternoon. Tushar and his family had reached the US in December, according to his friend. Tushar’s family was dead against talking to the media. However, a friend of Patel, on condition of anonymity, told Gujarat Samachar Digital that Tushar had embarked on his American dream two months ago unbeknownst to anyone close, including his paralysed mother. Family and friends were told that Tushar, his wife and son, were going on a Dubai trip. However, they had contacted an agent and had paid more than ₹25 lakh to enter the US. For the past one-and-a-half months, there was no contact between the deportee and his family. After returning to his house at Nilkanth Villa, Tushar was later seen leaving his residence in a car.

The court stated that the birth date recorded in the birth and death register would be considered the correct, verified birthdate of an individual. This observation by the court would prevent changes in the birthdate by an individual based on other identification documents such as Aadhar, PAN, and the school leaving certificate. The High Court bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agrawal and Justice Pranav Trivedi rejected a plea to change the birthdate  in the birth certificate. The court stated that with other documents, the date of birth is entered by the individuals, whereas the birth certificate has the date submitted by the hospital, making it a trustworthy source of verification. The plea was filed by an individual demanding a change in the birth certificate, stating that the birthdate in other documents were different from the one in their birth certificate. Opposing that, AMC argued that under the provision of Birth and Death Act 1969, changes in the birth certificate are non-permissible, and the records in the birth certificate also match with the records provided by the hospital authority. The applicant had also made a previous plea in the high court, which was rejected by a single judge.

For weeks, residents of Jamalpur and Khadia have been complaining about severe water supply and drainage problems, but their pleas reportedly were not addressed, alleged Khedawala. According to locals, the municipal authorities failed to resolve sewage blockages that have been causing dirty water to overflow into residential areas, pols, and narrow lanes. The situation has worsened over the past 15 days, with the main drainage line from Astodiya Darwaja to Panch Pipli and Navi Masjid are clogged. MLA Khedawala also accused civic officials of corruption, alleging that instead of fixing the problems, they were creating fake bills and mismanaging municipal funds. “Residents have been suffering due to the negligence of the authorities, and their basic needs like clean water and proper drainage are not being met. This cannot continue,” Khedawala said. Since the Municipal Commissioner was unavailable, Khedawala  met with Ramya Bhatt, In-charge Deputy Municipal Commissioner of the Central Zone, and voiced his concerns about the lack of response to public complaints. Khedawala urged officials to take immediate corrective measures before the situation deteriorates further.

Hina consulted her brother, Tanveer Karimi, who attempted to book the ticket but found that the provided code was invalid. Shortly after, the fraudster called again and convinced Hina to transfer ₹49,000 to a given bank account and an additional ₹23,000 through a QR code payment to get the flight tickets booked for her. Upon completing the transaction, the promised flight tickets were not received, and the scammer’s phone was switched off, raising suspicion of fraudulent activity. Realising she had been duped, Hina immediately contacted the cybercrime helpline (1930) to report the incident. The police have launched an investigation into the scam and are working to trace the perpetrator. The case is being handed over to the Karanj police station and they have started an investigation in the matter.

As per reports, the agents responsible for sending these individuals to the US have gone underground fearing arrest. To protect themselves from getting caught, these agents are actively working to ensure that the deported individuals do not stay at home, but instead keep moving to avoid exposing them. This situation has posed a challenge for law enforcement agencies. With the US intensifying its efforts to deport illegal immigrants from its shores, a total of 74 Gujaratis were sent back in three separate flights to India. After returning to India, these individuals were questioned by the police, creating panic among the agents involved in sending them abroad. To prevent being exposed, these agents have arranged for the deported individuals to avoid staying at their homes and instead keep moving. Meanwhile, the deported individuals, who had left India with big dreams, are now deeply distressed after spending huge sums of money only to be sent back. Considering the situation, the State Intelligence Bureau (SIB) has been verifying whether the deported individuals are indeed from Gujarat. According to SIB sources, details of the agents involved in this illegal immigration network will soon be gathered.

Khyati hospital row: Gujarat Medical Council suspends licenses of two doctors,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/khyati-hospital-row-gujarat-medical-council-suspends-licenses-of-two-doctors,2025-02-20,20,02,2025,"Gujarat Medical Council (GMC) has taken strict action against two doctors involved in the Khyati Hospital scam in Ahmedabad and suspended their medical licenses for a period of three years. The decision was taken during the General Body meeting of the Gujarat Medical Council. Sources said that the GMC meeting concluded with the decision to suspend the medical licenses of Dr Sanjay Muljibhai Patoliya (MBBS, MS Surgery) and Dr Shaileshkumar Amrutlal Anand (MBBS, DCM). The suspension was imposed under Section 22(1)(b)(i) of the Gujarat Medical Council Act, 1967, considering the seriousness of the case from a public health perspective. Both doctors have been ordered to surrender their licenses to the GMC immediately. The Khyati Multispeciality Hospital had organised a medical camp in Kadi under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) in which angiographies were performed on 19 persons who did not require the procedure and stents were implanted in their hearts during the medical camp. The malpractice came to light following the deaths of two patients, Nagarbhai Senma (59) and Mahesh Barot (45), after unnecessary angioplasty procedures in November 2024. Subsequent investigations uncovered additional deaths linked to the hospital's fraudulent activities, raising the death toll to nine. Authorities have arrested several individuals, including the hospital's CEO, Chirag Rajput, and medical director, Dr Sanjay Patoliya. The prime accused, hospital director Kartik Patel , was apprehended at Ahmedabad airport after a period of absconding. Authorities have warned that further legal actions may follow as the investigation into the scam continues. Khyati Multispeciality Hospital organised medical camps in rural areas, such as Borisana village in Mehsana district, under the guise of providing free health check-ups. During these camps, hospital staff misdiagnosed healthy individuals with severe cardiac conditions, convincing them to undergo unnecessary procedures like angioplasty. Investigations revealed that even young and asymptomatic patients, including an 18-year-old, were subjected to these invasive treatments. The hospital exploited the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), a government scheme offering health insurance coverage up to ₹5 lakh. By performing unwarranted procedures, Khyati Hospital fraudulently claimed substantial amounts from the scheme. Over 18 months, the hospital amassed approximately ₹11 crore, with 70% of this revenue derived from PM-JAY beneficiaries.

This initiative aims to enhance public safety and foster a sense of security within the community. The campaign specifically addresses the public carriage of weapons – including knives, daggers, swords, and firearms – as well as the dissemination of images featuring these items on popular platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Authorities have expressed concern over the growing trend of individuals flaunting weapons online, which they believe could incite violence and create an atmosphere of fear among residents. To facilitate community involvement, the Crime Branch has introduced a WhatsApp helpline number: 63596 25365. Citizens are encouraged to report sightings of individuals carrying weapons or posting related content by sharing photographs, names, and addresses or locations. The department assures informants that their identities will remain confidential and mentions the possibility of suitable rewards for valuable information. The necessity for this campaign arises from recent incidents where the display of weapons has escalated into violent confrontations, posing significant risks to public safety. By addressing both the physical presence of weapons and their virtual promotion, authorities aim to mitigate potential threats before they materialise. Mehul Chauhan, Crime Branch Police inspector stated “Upon receiving a complaint via the WhatsApp helpline, we will initiate a prompt investigation to verify the information. If the complaint is substantiated, appropriate legal action will be taken against the individual(s) involved, which may include arrest and prosecution under relevant sections of the law.

Parit Dhameliya from Surat had hacked the CCTV cameras of Payal hospital in Rajkot. Meanwhile, Ryan Robin Parera from Maharashtra hacked hospital CCTV cameras and sold the videos on Telegram. Vaibhav Bandu Mane, also from Maharashtra, was a partner of Prajwal Taili and was responsible for marketing the Telegram channel.

An investigating officer from the Ahmedabad Crime Branch revealed that these accused learned hacking through Telegram about a year ago. They then started hacking CCTV cameras, managing to breach over 50,000 cameras in the past nine months. The police have also uncovered the methods they used for hacking. The accused used two specific software tools to test and hack CCTV cameras. How did the accused manage to hack?

A Bangladeshi mobile number has also been identified, leading investigators to suspect that the videos were being sold outside India as well. CCTV video sellers earned in lakhs The hacking group earned around ₹5–6 lakh by selling the CCTV footage. They did not specifically target any location but attempted to hack all available cameras. They would collect footage from cameras that were easily hacked and sell the videos. Currently, police are investigating which other locations’ CCTV footage was compromised. Another accomplice, Rohit, is also under investigation. Additionally, authorities are examining how many people purchased the leaked videos. The highest demand was for CCTV footage from bedrooms and hospitals.

Rape survivor grabs  Sabarkantha Bank Director Mahesh Patel’s collar in public for helping accused,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/survivor-grabs-sabarkantha-bank-director-mahesh-patels-collar-in-public-for-helping-accused,2025-02-23,23,02,2025,"A public altercation broke out between a rape survivor and Mahesh Patel, the director of Sabarkantha Bank, leading to a scuffle in Ahmedabad. The incident escalated when the woman called the police control room, and the matter reached Navrangpura police station. As Mahesh Patel is an accused in cases registered in Sirohi and Jodhpur, a legal complication arose, leading to a compromise being reached, as per reports. An Ahmedabad-based woman had filed a rape complaint against BJP MLA and former minister Gajendrasinh Parmar from Prantij, Sabarkantha, at Sector 21 in Gandhinagar. On Saturday, she received information that Parmar would be arriving in a particular car at an event organised at Rajkot Nagarik Sahakari Bank in Navrangpura, Ahmedabad. Consequently, she reached the venue. When Patel, the director of Sabarkantha Bank, arrived in the same car at the event, the woman accused him of helping Gajendrasinh escape. This led to a heated argument between the woman and Patel, which escalated into a scuffle. The woman allegedly attacked him. Photos and videos of the entire incident have gone viral on social media. Following the altercation, the woman called the police control room, prompting the police to arrive at the scene. Meanwhile, Patel went to Navrangpura police station. However, since Patel has been accused under the POCSO Act in Rajasthan’s Sirohi and Jodhpur, the possibility of further legal entanglements led to no official complaint being filed.",ahmedabad
"Ahmedabad Cyber Crime comes across sale of CCTV footage from marriage halls, bus stations, beauty parlours",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-cyber-crime-uncovers-sale-of-cctv-footage-from-bus-stations-beauty-parlours,2025-02-23,23,02,2025,"The Ahmedabad Cyber Crime cell has concluded that hospital servers were hacked to sell footage in a case that violates women’s dignity. However, the biggest concern is that footage was obtained and sold from marriage halls, bus stations, dressing rooms in malls, and beauty parlours. Initially, free clips were sent, and later, subscriptions were sold, not just for footage but also for live telecasts. Investigations have revealed that footage from public places without CCTV cameras was obtained using hidden cameras. The cyber crime cell  is working with police from other states to uncover the nationwide network involved in this racket. A major disclosure is expected soon. The investigation into the viral CCTV footage from Payal Maternity Home & Surgical Hospital in Rajkot has led authorities to an international racket. The Ahmedabad Cyber Crime cell discovered that footage from 80 hospitals had been sold. Considering the severity of the crime, the state’s Home Department has invoked Section 66(F)(2) of the Information Technology Act, which falls under the category of cyber terrorism and carries a provision for life imprisonment. The hospital servers were hacked, and the footage was sold on social media platforms like YouTube and Instagram. The arrested individuals—Prajwal Ashok Taili, Praj Rajendra Patil, and Chandraprakash Phulchand —were caught from two states. During their nine-day remand, authorities are investigating how they obtained footage from places without CCTV cameras, whether through hidden cameras or other means. Kingpin remains unknown A critical concern in this case is that the accused charged subscribers between ₹800 and ₹4,000 to view the footage, earning ₹8 lakh to 10 lakh. Their ultimate goal was to earn ₹40 million and become millionaires. Questions remain about the origins of this idea, the network’s mastermind, the banking channels used to collect payments, and the QR codes used for transactions.

"Same destination, different budgets: Two Amdavadis share their Mahakumbh journey",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/same-destination-different-routes-price-of-reaching-mahakumbh-travellers-from-ahmedabad,2025-02-24,24,02,2025,"The Mahakumbh Mela, one of the largest religious gatherings in the world that occurs once every 144 years, serves as a reminder that while faith unites, the journey to experience it can be vastly different. Whether one spends ₹8,000 or ₹55,000, the final moment of taking a holy dip in the sacred waters of the Ganges remains the same — yet the path to get there tells two very different stories. Held this year in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, the event brings pilgrims from across the world together to take a holy dip in the sacred rivers, considered a deeply spiritual ritual in Hindu culture. However, the experience of reaching the mela varies drastically depending on one’s budget. Gujarat Samachar Digital presents you an account of two travellers from Ahmedabad who took different paths for the same journey to Prayagraj. Here they share their experiences. The budget traveller: Sacrificing comfort for devotion (₹8,000 journey) For those travelling on a modest budget, the Mahakumbh experience is one of endurance and faith. A smart middle-class devotee Hitendrakumar Modh, retired post office employee, managed the entire journey with just ₹8,000, a feat that required choosing the most economical options at every step. Sharing with GS digital, Modh said, “The pilgrimage began with a long, gruelling bus ride, slow, and tiring. We didn’t opt for accommodation, the bus itself was our bed for the trip. Meals were simple, cooked by the bus driver himself.” The real challenge they faced was when they were about to reach the destination. He said, “The last 26 km stretch to Prayagraj – What should’ve been a short distance took us 24 hours to cover, as there was heavy traffic. It was a test of our resilience — we were all physically tired, but hopeful as we were about to reach our destination.” Privileged traveller: Paying for ease and comfort (₹55,000 journey) On the other side of the spectrum was Nipun Soni, a jeweller,  who spent ₹55,000 on a Mahakumbh trip. A ₹40,000 round-trip flight from Ahmedabad to Prayagraj ensured they arrived within hours, bypassing the fatigue and delays faced by budget travellers. He shared, “From the airport, the 10 km trip to the mela in a cab at ₹3,000 took just an hour — swift and smooth, we had already done pre-booking for all the amenities we would need at the mela. We just reached the mela in an hour from the airport.” Rather than joining the crowds struggling for space on public boats, Soni, opted for a private boat ride costing ₹12,000, gliding across the water in peace. Their meals, while not lavish, were readily available, allowing them to focus on their spiritual journey without the strain of logistical challenges. Same water, different journeys At the heart of it all, the sacred river welcomed both travellers the same way. Whether one arrived after a long, exhausting ordeal or through a seamless, luxurious experience, the water remained unchanged. It did not differentiate based on how one arrived. This contrast reflects a broader reality — how much one is willing (or able) to pay determines the ease of access, but not the final experience of faith. Notably, the government played a crucial role in ensuring affordability, offering low-cost transportation and food, yet private operators capitalised on the event, charging exorbitant fees for convenience. As Mahakumbh 2025 concludes on February 26, coinciding with Shivratri, millions will carry home their experiences — some as a test of patience, others as a smooth pilgrimage. But in the end, whether spending thousands or tens of thousands, all pilgrims leave with the same sacred blessing, having touched the same divine waters.",ahmedabad

One of the videos shows a person walking inside a barrack, while another shows visuals of a meeting area for inmates. As soon as these videos went viral, an immediate investigation was launched. However, it was suspected that the videos were likely from a different jail, not Sabarmati Central Jail. As a result, the head of state prisons has ordered an inquiry. One of the videos was shared on Instagram by a user named Khumansinh Zala Dabhor. In this video, under trial prisoners can be seen sleeping in a barrack while a person is walking among them. Moreover, the title ""Aaram"" (Rest) was written on the video, suggesting it was from Sabarmati Jail. The second video was from the inmate visitation room. After these videos went viral, Sabarmati Jail DySP Paresh Solanki ordered a thorough inspection of all barracks in the jail. However, it was confirmed that the videos were not from Sabarmati Jail. Consequently, the authorities of Sabarmati Central Jail have decided to file a complaint with the Cyber Crime Cell regarding the matter. One of the individuals seen in the video, Khumansinh Zala, was an undertrial prisoner who served time at Sabarmati Jail from August 6, 2024, to September 25, 2024. However, it was found that the barrack in which he was housed was different from the one shown in the videos.

A few days ago, the girls left home, saying they were going to tuition but never returned.

Two minor boys from the same tuition were also missing, leading to further suspicion. The family began searching for them but found no trace, so they approached Sarkhej police. Considering the seriousness of the case, Inspector R K Dhuliya formed multiple investigation teams. However, since all their mobile phones were switched off, tracking their location became difficult. The police then monitored their Instagram and other social media accounts, eventually discovering that one of the boys was chatting from another mobile device and requesting money to extend their stay in Goa. Based on this lead, the Sarkhej police, with the help of Goa police, tracked them down and brought them back home, reuniting the minors with family.

"After sea-plane failure, air-taxis proposed in Ahmedabad",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/after-sea-plane-failure-air-taxis-proposed-in-ahmedabad,2025-02-24,24,02,2025,"After the termination of sea seaplane services in its nascent days that was slated to operate from the Sabarmati Riverfront to the Statue of Unity, the central government is considering the launch of air taxis in India now, similar to those in developed countries. These air taxis are battery-powered aircraft capable of electric vertical take-off and landing (e-VTOL). From Gujarat, Ahmedabad and Mandvi (Kutch) have been selected as trial sites for these air taxis. The central aviation department has chosen four trial sites in the country, including two other locations in Andhra Pradesh. Gujarat will be the first state in India to conduct this experiment. The objective of the central civil aviation department is to operate aircraft that generate minimal noise, consume less fuel, and are environmentally friendly. As part of efforts to promote advanced air mobility, small battery-powered aircraft capable of vertical take-off and landing, also known as air taxis, will be tested. These aircraft are officially termed 'e-VTOL'. Similar to helicopters, these small aircraft can take off and land vertically, eliminating the need for a runway. A report by the Central Civil Aviation Department confirms that sensor-equipped and latest software-integrated air taxis are safer than helicopters. The report specifically mentions that the possibility of launching air taxis in India is being considered, and a team of experts, along with the Directorate of Civil Aviation, has visited Gujarat. It has been decided to conduct air taxi trials from the Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad. Additionally, Mandvi in Kutch has also been selected as a trial site. Both these locations have been chosen as trial sites, along with two cities in Andhra Pradesh. If the trials prove successful, air taxi services could begin in India within a year or two. Currently, the central civil aviation department has started preparations for conducting trial-based air taxi flights. While the fate of the seaplane service remains uncertain, it is difficult to predict how much public response the air taxi initiative will receive in Gujarat. Features of e-VTOL The e-VTOL aircraft is environmentally friendly since it runs on batteries and produces minimal noise. This makes it eco-friendly. It does not require a runway and can take off like a helicopter. The air taxi can accommodate two to six passengers at a time and can travel up to 250 km on a single battery charge. Equipped with sensors and advanced software, they are reportedly considered safer than helicopters. However, flying in hilly areas could be risky, suggest the experts.

In 2018, he agreed with Gohil, proprietor of Ganesh Tours and Travels, to sell 33 buses for ₹2.2 crore. The terms required Gohil to clear pending RTO taxes, settle bank loans, and make full payment before the ownership transfer. However, Patel alleges that despite taking possession of the buses, Gohil failed to make the necessary payments, resulting in mounting dues, including unpaid RTO taxes of ₹3.5 crore. Patel also claimed he was promised a 5% share from the bus operations, which was never paid. In December 2021, Gohil allegedly provided a notarised letter assuring that all pending payments would be settled within nine months. However, Patel claims that only ₹1.5 crore was paid since 2020, while the remaining dues continued to pile up.

40% mortality rate after liver transplant at IKDRC raise alarms,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/140-liver-transplants-in-two-years-40-mortality-rate-sparks-concern-in-gujarat-vidhan-sabha,2025-02-25,25,02,2025,"During the ongoing budget session of Gujarat Vidhan Sabha, issues were raised about deaths of patients after liver transplant in the last two years at the Institute of Kidney Disease and Research Centre (IKDRC) in the Asarwa Civil Hospital campus. It was noted that approximately, 40% (around 54-56 patients) lost their lives after the liver transplant, indicating to a dangerous trend. Of these, approximately 40% (around 54-56 patients) lost their lives after the transplant, making it a key topic of discussion. The increase in post-transplant deaths has been attributed to various factors, including pneumonia, infections, donor organ inefficiency, infections from the liver donor, hepatic duct infections, tuberculosis, cancer, lung failure, and cardiac arrest. Additionally, poor patient health, malnutrition, alcohol-related cardiomyopathy, advanced age, severe end-stage liver disease, and recent kidney injuries have also contributed to the high mortality rate following liver transplants. According to a government report released recently, 2,634 kidney transplants and 469 liver transplants have been performed at the Kidney Hospital within the Asarwa Civil Hospital premises in Ahmedabad over the past nine years. Out of these, 134 kidney transplant recipients and 173 liver transplant recipients died while undergoing treatment at the hospital. The report also mentioned that a committee was being considered to explore ways to reduce the post-transplant mortality rate. Doctors emphasize that following a prescribed diet after kidney and liver transplants is crucial for recovery. However, many patients fail to adhere to the recommended diet, significantly increasing the risk of health complications. It has also been reported that the hospital also lacks a system to monitor how many patients return for follow-ups after undergoing transplants.

No escape from traffic at road to Makarba underbridge even in the afternoon,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/no-escape-from-traffic-at-makarba-underbridge-even-at-noon,2025-02-25,25,02,2025,"The LC-26 underbridge on government documents, and commonly known as the Makarba underbridge to the locals, is turning out to be a bottleneck all day long. One which troubled commuters during peak hours in the morning and evening is  now causing frequent hold-ups even in the afternoons. Connecting the corporate road to Sarkhej lake, this small passageway under the railway track has become  a daily headache for commuters. Mostly working professionals, these commuters wait for long hours, waiting to break free from this roughly 150-metre stretch, marred by poorly designed turns, u-turns, and sideways. For commuters wanting to access Kataria Tower Road, they have to make a U-turn after exiting the underbridge at Sarkhej lake on a small road. This small road, with high walls, broken pavement, and vegetation on the road right beside the exit of the underbridge, is where the problem lies. When the underbridge was inaugurated  a year ago, it was an instant hotspot for traffic during office hours in the morning and evening. Months later, even the afternoons witness unmoving traffic. No solution in sight As earlier reported by Gujarat Samachar Digital, the traffic at the corporate road and the internal roads leading to and from this underbridge, is managed by good samaritans acting as volunteers to free up the vehicle flow. While the lack of regular TRB (Traffic Regulatory Brigade) officials at the Makarba crossing has caused traffic jams on the entire stretch, the overall problems persist as civic authorities have failed to arrive at a long term solution. The busy crossroads do not even have traffic signals. Despite multiple representations to the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC), the construction of pavement, illegally parked vehicles that constrict the already narrow road, frequent movement of dumpers and luxury buses have ensured that the bottleneck continues. Lack of foresight to the growing number of vehicles and poor design at the entry of the underbridge have resulted in loss of valuable productive hours for the citizens. How long before we see any action from the AMC and the traffic police?",ahmedabad
Ahmedabad’s historic first: Bhadrakali procession on Foundation Day after 614 years,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabads-historic-first-bhadrakali-procession-on-foundation-day-after-614-years,2025-02-25,25,02,2025,"Nagardevi Shri Bhadrakali Mata Temple (File photo) People of Ahmedabad have always enjoyed the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath, the city’s presiding deity. However, for the first time, Goddess Bhadrakali, the city’s ‘nagardevi’ (guardian goddess), will embark on a grand chariot procession through the streets of Ahmedabad to bless her devotees. This historic event is scheduled for Wednesday, coinciding with Maha Shivaratri. 614 years of history The Rath Yatra is being organised to mark Ahmedabad’s 614th foundation anniversary. The chariot procession will pass through the city’s fort area, especially places of religious and historical significance associated with the goddess. As the idol of Goddess Bhadrakali is permanently enshrined in the temple, her sacred footprints will be carried on the chariot in  the procession. According to sources, Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel is likely to inaugurate the first-ever Nagar Yatra of Goddess Bhadrakali. Shashikant Tiwari, a temple trustee, stated that this is the first time such an event is being organised by the temple. The Rath Yatra is receiving support from the police department, municipal corporation, and pilgrimage development board. Thousands of devotees are expected to participate in the event. The Rath Yatra will include around 90 vehicles, 3 akharas (martial arts groups), 3 tableau trucks, and 3 devotional music groups. Devotees will be offered Boondhi prasad (sweet offerings). The journey will commence from Teen Darwaza and pass through Baba Maneknath’s shrine, Manek Chowk, Danapith, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation office, Khamasa, and Pagthiya, before reaching Jagannath Temple in Jamalpur, where a brief stop will be made. The procession will then move towards the Mahalaxmi Temple before returning to the Bhadrakali temple. Historic procession Historians believe that since the founding of Ahmedabad by Sultan Ahmed Shah, the Bhadrakali Temple has remained an important spiritual centre. According to temple records, King Karnadev built the temple, and an annual procession was held for centuries. However, during the Mughal rule, some rigid rulers prohibited the procession, leading to its discontinuation. Many Hindu and Jain temples were damaged, affecting religious traditions, including the Rath Yatra. Since then, no efforts have been made to revive the procession. 5,000 devotees to be served bhandara Around 5,000 devotees will be served bhandara (religious feast) as part of the event. Special fast-friendly prasad will also be provided in honour of Maha Shivaratri. The Bhadrakali Temple Trust plans to make this Rath Yatra an annual tradition if it receives strong community support. Nagar Yatra timings After the ritual decoration and morning Aarti, the Nagar Yatra will commence at 8 am. The chariot will first visit the location of Mataji’s sacred palm imprints, then proceed to Teen Darwaza, Baba Maneknath’s shrine, and Manek Chowk. From there, the chariot will pass through Danapith and the AMC office, where it will be welcomed by the mayor and other officials. The procession will continue through Khamasa and Pagthiya to reach the Jagannath Temple. After that, the chariot will visit Gaikwad Haveli and reach the Sabarmati Riverfront, where a special Aarti will be performed for the Sabarmati River. The final stops will include Vasant Chowk, Sidi Saiyyed Mosque, Kotha Hanuman Temple, and Bahuchar Mata Temple, before returning to the Bhadrakali Temple. The event will conclude with a Havan (sacred fire ritual) and Bhandara .",ahmedabad

Stories that you must know as Ahmedabad turns 614 years old!,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/stories-that-you-must-know-as-ahmedabad-turns-614-years-old,2025-02-26,26,02,2025,"Ahmedabad, colloquially known as Amdavad, has many stories intertwined with it. As the city turns 614 years old on Wednesday, the myths, the bylanes and heritage eagerly await to be rediscovered and retold. With the  city turning into the tech and employment capital of Gujarat, many citizens are still unaware of its rich cultural and historical significance which has earned it the tag of India’s first UNESCO World Heritage City in 2017. In the heart of the city, and amid the bustling lanes of iconic Teen Darwaza, Akhand Jyot (eternal lamp) has been burning for over 600 years. The Akhand Jyot, nestled in one of the walls of Teen Darwaza serves as a testimony to the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb since the foundation of the city on February 26, 1411. Akhand Jyot, Teen Darwaza, Ahmedabad A popular lore attached to Akhand Jyot goes like this - Khwaja Siddiqui, a guard posted at Teen Darwaza during the reign of Sultan Ahmed Shah Badshah, the founder of Ahmedabad, saw a beautiful, divine woman leaving the city one night. On inquiring, he came to know that the woman was none other than Goddess Laxmi herself. Upon learning that Goddess Laxmi was leaving Ahmedabad, the guard saw it as the city’s prosperity departing. He stopped her, insisting she seek permission from Badshah Ahmed Shah. He then made her promise to stay until his return. To ensure her presence, he sacrificed his life. Honouring her word, Goddess Laxmi never left the city. A green-coloured tomb, named, ‘Hazrat Shahid Sidi Badshah Ni Dargah’ proudly stands outside one of the gates of Bhadra Fort and is believed to be of the guard Siddique. The statue of Goddess Laxmi Devi is seen in the garden opposite Bhadra Fort. Notably, an imprint of the hand of Goddess Laxmi had been embedded in one of the gates of Bhadra Fort, suggesting the folklore to be true. Bhadra Fort & Goddess Laxmi's hand imprint Manek Baba, destroyer & creator of Ahmedabad Constructing Ahmedabad was a mammoth task for Ahmed Shah as Manek Baba, a yogi, was unhappy with the Sultan taking over his land. Maneknath or Manek Baba was a renowned saint of Ahmedabad who lived in the 15th century by the banks of Sabarmati River. Ahmed Shah faced an unusual challenge while building the walls of Ahmedabad—each night, they mysteriously collapsed. Determined to uncover the cause, he discovered that Manek Baba was using his mystical powers, knitting a blanket by day and unravelling it at night, causing the walls to fall. It is said that Manek Baba requested Badshah to build something, so that the city remembers him. The Badshah honoured him by naming the city’s central square in Tankshal- Manek Chowk, after him. Manek Baba also helped Badshah in building the city using his powers. Manek Burj, a remnant of the old wall near Ellisbridge, is believed to safeguard Ahmedabad from destruction. Manek Burj & Manek Baba Temple Pols of Amdavad The old city of Ahmedabad is home to a network of over 200 narrow lanes, where Amdavadis live in houses dating back to as old as 400 years. ‘Muhurat ni Pol’, as the name suggests, was the first pol of Ahmedabad. Pols of Ahmedabad The area of the walled city is 5.78 sq km, and it has around 360 pols, and each pol consists of 45-60 houses. “From the oldest typical pol house to the most recent house in 2022, pol houses have always been influenced by the designs and ideas of the period they are built in,” according to a study by CEPT University. As per the study, houses within the pol have a unique design element, naturally regulating temperature and providing comfort in the hot climate of Ahmedabad, especially during summer when temperatures spike up to 45°C. The city is an intricate web of stories, reminiscent of the past that made its way into the contemporary world. Amdavadis still take pride in the popular folklore, “Jab kutte pe sassa aaya, tab Badshah ne shaher basaya.” (While camping on the banks of the Sabarmati River, Sultan Ahmed Shah saw a rabbit chasing a dog. Impressed by the bravery of the rabbit, he decided to establish Ahmedabad as his capital city.)

In a scathing email addressed to NID’s administration, a graduating student has condemned the way the 44th convocation ceremony was conducted, calling it a ""cold, soulless, bureaucratic sham"". The email, widely circulated among students and faculty, criticised the exclusion of parents, juniors, and even the Student Activity Council (SAC) from key aspects of the event, raising serious concerns about transparency and student representation. A red carpet for VVIPs, a sidewalk for graduates One of the key grievances voiced by students was the exclusion of parents from key campus spaces, including studios and workshops where students had spent years honing their craft. Instead, they were reportedly confined to Eames Plaza, while elaborate arrangements were made for the President of India, the event’s chief guest. Students alleged that they were asked to walk beside the red carpet instead of on it, so as not to ‘dirty’ it before the President’s arrival. “If that doesn't sum up just how little NID values its own students, I don’t know what does,” the student wrote in the email. A convocation without celebration Students were further angered by the administration's decision to bar juniors from attending the convocation. Many also complained that the live-streaming link was cut off the moment the President left, preventing friends and family who were not physically present from witnessing the ceremony. The Student Activity Council (SAC), which is supposed to represent student concerns, was allegedly kept in the dark about the convocation arrangements. “If you’re going to run things behind closed doors, why even have an SAC?” the email questioned. 'You only convocate once' – except this time The final straw for many was the last-minute cancellation of YOCO (You Only Convocate Once), a long-standing tradition where graduates gather for a final farewell. A notice issued at 8.30 pm—after students had already assembled—banned postgraduate students from attending, forcing them to leave without a proper goodbye. A copy of the letter sent by the student to NID administration, faculty, and students Students demand change The letter, which has resonated with many in the NID community, calls for an end to VVIP-centric convocations and urges future batches to prevent their graduation from being “hijacked for political agendas"". In a parting message to faculty, the student pleaded, “Stand with the students, not with the power-hungry administration that clearly has no interest in preserving what NID once stood for.” Till going for publication, NID’s administration had not responded to the concerns raised. However, the controversy has sparked a larger debate on the institution’s evolving culture, transparency, and the balance between tradition and protocol.",ahmedabad

The complainant, Sarthak Kamleshbhai Mohanthal, residing in Anandnagar, received a call on July 5, 2024 from an unknown number claiming to be from a law enforcement agency. The caller alleged that a parcel addressed to him had been seized in Taiwan, containing five passports, ₹35,000 in cash, and 200 grams of illegal drugs. The caller further claimed that his Aadhaar details were linked to criminal activities, including drug trafficking and money laundering. To convince him, the fraudsters orchestrated a video call through Skype, during which they pressured him to cooperate with an 'investigation' to prove his innocence. They instructed him to isolate himself from family members and relocate to a hotel for two days. Under the pretext of following government regulations, they convinced him to transfer 98% of his savings to specific bank accounts for 'verification'. Fearing legal repercussions, Sarthak complied and transferred ₹52.12 lakh through RTGS to multiple bank accounts, as per the scammers’ instructions. However, realising he had been deceived, he reported the incident to the cybercrime helpline (1930) and filed a formal complaint with the Anandnagar police station.

Authorities have urged citizens to remain vigilant against such frauds, emphasising that no law enforcement agency demands money transfers for verification purposes. Individuals receiving suspicious calls should report them immediately to cybercrime authorities.",ahmedabad

The district collector has handed over approximately 40,000 sq m of land worth around ₹25 crore in Ognaj to AMC. At this site, an Art World Park is planned to be developed at a cost of ₹15 crore from public funds and ₹5 crore from the developer. While the land belongs to the government and 75% of the project cost will be funded by the public, the AMC has proposed keeping only a 26% share in its revenue. However, the proposal has not been approved yet. The AMC’s Garden Department had invited a Request for Proposal (RFP) to develop a lake in Ognaj as a Waste-to-Art World Park. The administration received bids from three agencies, and based on the marking system, Z-Tech India Limited was selected as the top-ranked bidder. The level of dominance of the administrative body over the ruling party was evident in the Recreation Committee meeting. Even though the proposal for the ₹20 crore was presented for approval, the Garden Department officials failed to provide specific details regarding the corporation’s planning. After the meeting, Chairman Jayesh Trivedi stated that the park would feature monument-style replicas of iconic artworks from five continents – Asia, Africa, Europe, US, and North America – created using waste materials. However, he also mentioned that no details had been provided to the committee members. Previously, five presentations had been given to the former commissioner regarding this project, but in this meeting, only one presentation was shown, and officials could not answer many crucial questions. No decision has been made on the proposal for now.

The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) staged a protest, alleging improper online rechecking of answer sheets. Many students allegedly failed by just one or two marks, and as per regulations, grace marks were not awarded. However, Gujarat University claims that the overall pass percentage is 86%. ABVP has submitted a written complaint stating that the results declared on February 20 are completely unacceptable. The complaint highlights that in subjects like Medicine, Radiology, Pathology, Paediatrics, Emergency Medicine, and Pharmacology, less than 50% of students have passed in many colleges. It has also been noted that students who scored well in Paper 1 and practical exams have failed in Paper 2 and 3, which seems highly illogical. After students applied for rechecking, the university conducted digital rechecking as per commission rules. However, ABVP has alleged that the process was not done properly. Even after rechecking, 115 students have still failed, and their results have not improved. So, there is a strong demand for another rechecking process, but this time through physical verification. Notably, as per the regulations of the National Medical Commission (NMC), reevaluation or reassessment is not permitted for PG medical exams, nor can grace marks be awarded. This means that the failed students will have to retake the exam.

"GST cases worth ₹5000 cr pending in Gujarat, Tribunals yet to be formed",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gst-cases-worth-5000-cr-pending-in-gujarat-tribunals-yet-to-be-formed,2025-03-06,6,03,2025,"Even after six months since the Central Government announced the formation of GST Tribunals, they have yet to be established, leaving GST taxpayers in distress. Due to the absence of a tribunal, taxpayers are forced to appeal against the Commissioner’s decision in the high court. However, with thousands of cases already pending in the high court, resolutions are significantly delayed. Over the past ten years, GST-related cases worth ₹5,000 crore have been stuck in courts, yet neither the Central nor the State Government has taken any steps to resolve them, leaving taxpayers frustrated. The announcement of setting up a GST Tribunal was made six months ago, claiming to benefit taxpayers fighting GST appeal cases. However, as its implementation is still pending, both taxpayers and tax professionals are struggling. On one hand, GST officials are conducting raids, but on the other hand, when taxpayers approach the GST Appellate Commissioner, they often find the officials siding with the GST authorities. In such circumstances, taxpayers should have the option to approach the GST Tribunal, but since it has not been established yet, they are left with no choice but to approach the high court.

"Attempt to shoot reel turns tragic: Scorpio plunges into Fatehwadi Canal, 2 dead, 1 missing",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/attempt-to-shoot-reel-turns-tragic-scorpio-plunges-into-fatehwadi-canal-leaves-2-dead-1-missing,2025-03-06,6,03,2025,"A tragic incident in the Fatehwadi Canal near the Juhapura-Sarkhej area has left the city in shock. In a reckless attempt to shoot social media reels, three young men drove a rented Scorpio car into the canal, resulting in two confirmed fatalities while one remains missing. The first body recovered was that of Yaksh Bhankodiya. According to sources, Yaksh was initially driving the vehicle but handed over control to Yash Solanki moments before the accident. After hours of search operation, Yash’s body was also found. However, there is still no trace of Krish Dave, the third occupant of the ill-fated vehicle. Deceased 13-hour search operation continues For over 13 hours, Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services teams have been tirelessly scouring the canal in the hope of finding Krish. Investigations reveal that Yaksh was at the wheel initially, but upon reaching a stretch near Vasna Barrage Road, he let Yash take over. Unfortunately, Yash was inexperienced in driving and mistakenly pressed the accelerator instead of the brake, sending the car plunging straight into the canal, police sources said. The vehicle was rented for ₹3,500 for a 4-hour duration, with the intention of recording reels to showcase on social media. M Division Traffic Police have launched an investigation into the incident. Authorities have once again urged parents to be vigilant as the obsession with social media fame is increasingly putting young lives at risk. How it all unfolded The series of events unfolded on Wednesday evening when Maulik Jaleria rented a self-drive Scorpio car. He, along with Uday Vyanta (New Vasna) and Dhruv Solanki (Vejalpur), drove to Vasna Bhatha Canal Road, where they met friends Viraj Singh Rathod (Paldi), Yaksh Bhankodiya (Ambawadi), Yash Solanki (Ambawadi), and Krish Dave (Paldi). Yaksh took the car for a drive from Vasna Barrage Road before allowing Yash to take control. At the time, Krish was also inside the vehicle. However, Yash’s lack of driving skills proved fatal—his mistake sent the car straight into the canal. Realising the gravity of the situation, Viraj Singh Rathod attempted to rescue them by throwing a rope, but the three youths were already being swept away by the strong currents. Nearby locals rushed to the scene and immediately alerted the fire brigade and police control room. Following the distress call, officers from Vasna police station, including Police Inspector R N Patel and senior officials, arrived promptly at the scene. Local divers were also engaged in the search, but they found no occupants inside the submerged vehicle. Water flow in barrage stopped Preliminary police reports indicate that the youths had rented the vehicle solely for the purpose of shooting reels and had driven to the canal for this purpose. Upon learning of the tragedy, the police informed the families of the victims, who arrived at the location as rescue operations were underway. Local councillor Mehul Shah stated that upon receiving news of the car sinking, authorities swiftly halted the water flow from the barrage and used a crane to retrieve the vehicle. Fire brigade officials have also alerted villages along the canal’s route to assist in locating the missing individual. As search efforts continue, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by reckless behaviour in pursuit of fleeting social media fame. Authorities are urging young individuals to exercise caution and prioritise safety over viral content.",ahmedabad

Police investigations have confirmed that two of the victims were minors, including the one who was driving the vehicle when it plunged into the canal. On Friday morning around 10.45 am, the body of the third victim, Krish Dave, was recovered from the canal by Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Department. In an attempt to shoot reels, three young men drove a rented Scorpio car to the canal, which ultimately led to deaths of three. The first body recovered from the canal, which falls under the jurisdiction of Vejalpur police, was that of 17-year-old Yaksh Bhankodiya. According to sources, Yaksh was initially driving the vehicle, but handed over control to 17-year-old Yash Solanki moments before the accident. Hours later, Yash’s body was also recovered by officials from Vasna police jurisdiction. However, search operations were underway for Krish Dave (19), the third occupant of the vehicle, who remains untraceable. Car without commercial numberplate During the preliminary investigation, police found that the Scorpio car belonged to Saurav Gupta, a tour and travel agency owner based near Himalaya Mall. Gupta had rented the Scorpio, a private vehicle. On Wednesday evening, Maulik Jaleria, a friend of Gupta, rented the Scorpio car for six hours, stating that he needed it for a temple visit. However, instead of a religious trip, Maulik, along with Uday Vyanta (New Vasna) and Dhruv Solanki (Vejalpur), took the vehicle to Canal Road, where they met their friends Viraj Singh Rathod (Paldi), Yaksh Bhankodiya (Ambawadi), Yash Solanki (Ambawadi), and Krish Dave (Paldi). Yaksh then took over the vehicle and drove the car along Vasna Barrage Road, intending to record reels. Moments later, he let Yash take the wheel. Yash’s inexperience came to the fore when he pressed the accelerator instead of the brake, causing the vehicle to plunge into the canal. Police to take action against those involved Shivam Varma, DCP Zone 7, confirmed that an investigation is underway to determine how the minors accessed a rental vehicle. ""We will register a case under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and the Motor Vehicles Act. Additionally, we are investigating how a private vehicle was being illegally used for commercial rental purposes,"" he stated. Officials have confirmed that a case will be registered against those responsible for providing the vehicle, particularly for negligence in allowing minors to drive. The owner of the Scorpio will also be interrogated regarding the unauthorised use of a private vehicle for commercial rental. CCTV cameras installed just 2 days before incident Interestingly, just two days before the accident, the police had begun installing CCTV cameras along the Vasna Canal stretch. Four solar-powered cameras, equipped with motion and voice detection sensors, captured the entire sequence of events, providing crucial footage for the investigation. A senior police official stated, ""The newly installed cameras played a vital role in understanding how the accident occurred. We plan to install 15 more such cameras across Vasna jurisdiction for enhanced surveillance."" Constable risked life for rescue attempt At approximately 5.45 pm, a police control room (PCR) patrol van was in the vicinity of Vasna Canal when locals alerted them to the accident. Without hesitation, the police rushed to the scene. Police Sub-Inspector H M Gohil, along with Constable Manojbhai Vinodbhai and his team, arrived at the spot. Manojbhai, who is a skilled swimmer, bravely jumped into the canal with a rope in an attempt to rescue the victims. However, by then, two of the victims had already been swept away by the strong currents. Thinking that one of them might still be trapped inside the car, the officers broke the vehicle’s window but found it empty. In 2024, Manoj had resued a women from drowing in Sabarmati river near Ambedkar bridge area. In the incident, a family of four including a woman named Heena, her 5-year-old kid, mother and brother had tried to die by suicide.

A video has gone viral showing a minor student being assaulted by fellow students in the government hostel of Pachchham village. The viral video shows two male students performing a heinous act of inserting a foreign object in the private parts of a fellow male student. The victim can be heard crying out in pain, but despite his suffering, the perpetrators continue to torment him. The victim’s cries and screams were ignored, and instead, he was beaten further to silence him. He was assaulted with slippers and sticks. The entire incident was recorded by another student. Other students in the room witnessed the brutality, but no one stepped in to stop it. The victim kept crying, yet the perpetrators showed no mercy. The severity of his injuries was evident, and fear prevented him from even calling for help. The district police have initiated a complaint process regarding this incident. Meanwhile, the education department has been urged to take immediate action. However, a crucial question arises—since the perpetrators are minors, will strict action be taken against them? Many believe that to set an example, severe action must be taken against these students. According to mental health experts, incidents like this leave a lifelong impact on a person’s mind. The victim may develop phobias, suffer from psychological trauma, and be haunted by thoughts of how society, parents, and others perceive him. He might even lose his self-confidence and, in extreme cases, take drastic steps. Victims of such incidents often require continuous psychological counselling to recover, and even then, not everyone can overcome the trauma. This suffering extends not only to the victim but also to their entire family, who must endure the consequences of this horrifying act.

How a fake baba duped an Ahmedabad family of ₹3 lakh in 'Nagdosh' ritual scam,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/how-a-fake-baba-duped-an-ahmedabad-family-of-inr-3-lakh-in-nagdosh-ritual,2025-03-11,11,03,2025,"Image: AI generated A self-proclaimed monk and his accomplice allegedly deceived a man from Ahmedabad’s Satellite area of ₹3.01 lakh in cash and jewellery under the pretext of performing a ‘Nagdosh’ ritual. The Satellite police have registered a case and launched an investigation into the matter. Start with a simple request for alms As per the complainant Roshanbhai Tenuji Dhobi, the incident began on January 12, when a man dressed as a monk visited his residence in Gokul Awas Yojana, seeking alms. Feeling compassionate, Roshanbhai gave him ₹10, but the monk warned him of a ‘Nagdosh’ (a supposed astrological defect) in his fate and offered to perform a ritual to remove it. The two exchanged contact numbers. Days later, on January 16, Roshanbhai received a call from the monk, demanding ₹17,000 to perform the ritual. Trusting him, he transferred the amount via PhonePe to the number provided. Gold, silver, and cash provided for the ritual The scam escalated when Roshanbhai received another call on January 22, from a man claiming to be the monk’s ‘Guru’. He falsely assured Roshanbhai that he had ancestral land and hidden jewellery in Rajasthan, but a ritual was required before he could claim it. On January 26, Roshanbhai, accompanied by his wife Arunaben and their two daughters, went to Adalaj’s Tri Mandir as instructed. There, they handed over gold and silver ornaments worth lakhs, along with ₹45,000 in cash, to the fraudsters for the ritual. The monk handed over a vessel (matte) wrapped in red cloth, stating that the cash and jewellery were inside it and that they should only open it once the ritual was complete. Demand for ₹11 lakh raises suspicion The fraudsters later demanded an additional ₹11 lakh, claiming it was necessary for the ritual's completion. Growing suspicious, Roshanbhai checked the locked vessel (matte) they had been given and found it empty, confirming that they had been deceived. Among the valuables surrendered were a gold necklace weighing 2 tolas (approx. ₹2.8 lakh), a gold chain weighing 1 tola (₹30,000), a pair of gold earrings (₹60,000), a silver anklet weighing 500 grams (₹30,000). The total loss amounted to ₹3,01,000, including jewellery, cash, and a mobile phone. After repeated failed attempts to contact the fraudsters, Roshanbhai and his sister-in-law Shardaben finally approached the Satellite police to file a complaint. Following the registration of the FIR, the police are now tracing the fraudsters using mobile records and financial transactions.",ahmedabad
BJP youth leaders illegally set up stalls on AMC plot in Gota to earn ‘extra’ income,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/bjp-youth-leaders-illegally-set-up-stalls-on-amc-plot-in-gota-to-earn-extra-income,2025-03-11,11,03,2025,"Local BJP leaders are allegedly planning to acquire an Amdavad Municipal Corporation plot near Gota Bridge in Ahmedabad, to illegally set up stalls and generate income. In the AMC Standing Committee meeting, a proposal was cleared to acquire a plot in the name of a BJP worker to start a home industry. However, BJP youth office-bearers adopted a strategy to allow others to set up illegal stalls on the land and rent them out for profit. Advertisements have also been placed at the location, stating that stalls are available for rent. Reports suggest that BJP office-bearers in the civic body have been facilitating the illegal setup of these stalls through their recommendations. On January 16, 2025, a meeting of the Standing Committee was held. A proposal was approved under an urgent agenda to lease out a 5,000-square-metre area of Final Plot No. 66 of TP Scheme No. 32 in the Gota ward for six months at a token rent of ₹1,000 per day, including municipal taxes. However, the BJP youth wing’s office-bearers have allegedly partnered with the worker to obtain the plot and rapidly set up stalls using iron barricades. Despite the structures being installed on the leased municipal plot, the municipal authorities have only issued notices rather than taking concrete action. The total municipal plot near Gota Bridge covers more than 24,000 sqm. In the leased area, stalls have been built using iron angles, bricks, and cement. Contrary to the resolution passed by the Standing Committee, the space has been turned into a marketplace where household items, children’s and women’s clothing, and other goods are being sold in rented stalls. Moreover, food stalls have been set up. Despite this situation, AMC has only issued notices and no further action has been taken. The proposal to lease part of the municipal plot near Gota Bridge for ₹1,000 per day was approved in the Standing Committee after a BJP office-bearer recommended it. It is being reported that apart from BJP workers, two to three BJP youth office-bearers are involved in establishing a market in this space through partnerships.

As a part of the plan, green nets will be installed at traffic junctions in different wards across the city. Moreover, in a big relief to citizens, traffic signals of the city will be turned off for 6 hours (11 am to 4 pm), so that commuters don't have to stop at crossroads and can avoid heat-related discomfort. Citizens have been advised to avoid going outdoors between 12 noon and 4 pm unless necessary. AMC, with the help of NGOs, will set up drinking water stations. Each of the seven zones of the city will have 50 such water stations. With the onset of March, the city’s maximum temperature has already crossed 40°C. In schools under the AMC School Board, where more than 1.5 lakh students study, and in private schools across the city, a water bell rings every hour to remind students to stay hydrated. On the days when extreme heat warnings are issued, school timings will be adjusted accordingly. In addition to roads, green nets will also be installed at AMTS and BRTS bus stops, and water stations will be set up at these locations. ORS (oral rehydration solution) packets will be distributed at all bus stops as well as urban and community health centres. AMC-run hospitals will provide treatment for heat-related illnesses. Around 2,00,000 labourers work at more than 700 construction sites across the city. During extreme heat conditions, all construction activities will be halted from 12 noon to 4 pm.

The court ordered the CBI to conduct further investigation through all the high-tech and advanced technologies of the present era by an officer of the rank of superintendent of police and submit a report within 60 days. Jaladhi Trivedi, then a 16-year-old girl (28-year-old now) who went missing in 2014, has not not been traced even after over a decade of her disappearance. The CBI court noted that, upon reviewing the documents of the CBI investigation, sufficient investigation has not been conducted based on the passport's fingerprints.  “Even in the current era of technology, by involving an FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory) officer, an extensive investigation has not been carried out in this case.” The court also emphasised that a thorough investigation into the social media tracing of the missing girl keeping a cyber crime expert is yet to be done. A passport fingerprint activity is also yet to be shared by the passport authorities and home department. Strong objection against closure report by Jaladhi's father Jaladhi's father strongly objected to the closure report submitted by the CBI, who have failed to find his minor daughter even after so many years and haven't been able to trace her. It was stated that the CBI's closure report doesn't mention anywhere whether Jaladhi has gone abroad or is deceased. In this modern and technology-driven era, documents like Aadhar Card and Passport are essential identity proofs for travelling, hospitalisation, and tracing any individual. However, the CBI has not conducted sufficient investigation regarding these, emphasised the father. He demanded rejection of CBI's closure report and asked the court to order further investigation. Who is Jaladhi Trivedi? It was the fateful day of October 4, 2014 when Class 11 Commerce student Jaladhi was last seen. She went missing after her tuition class ended at 6 pm on October 4 in 2014. According to reports, she was last seen near Gita Mandir and after that, no trace was to be found by Kagdapith Police, who registered the case, along with CID Crime and CBI. The Gujarat High Court had transferred entire case to CBI on February 7, 2018. The CBI then submitted a closure report including 56 statement and 442 document evidence.

Man dies by suicide in Khokhara due to harassment by loan shark,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/man-dies-by-in-khokhara-due-to-harassment-by-loan-shark,2025-03-16,16,03,2025,"A tragic case has come to light in Amraiwadi, where a middle-aged man died by suicide eight months ago due to harassment from a loan shark and a lawyer. The deceased had borrowed ₹10 lakh from a friend by mortgaging his shop documents. Despite repaying ₹47 lakh, he was still pressured to pay an additional ₹25 lakh. The victim’s son, a stock market broker residing in Ramol, filed a complaint against the lawyer and the loan shark, alleging that his father, Nutankumar (53), took his own life on July 8, 2024, in his Khokhara office by hanging himself. At that time, Amraiwadi Police registered a case of accidental death and began an investigation. However, a suicide note was later discovered, in which the deceased blamed his friend and a lawyer for his decision to end his life. According to the complaint, the victim initially took a ₹10 lakh loan at interest but ended up repaying ₹47 lakh. Despite this, his so-called friend continued demanding another ₹25 lakh, leading to severe financial pressure. A police complaint was filed at that time, and a settlement was later reached, reducing the amount to ₹14 lakh. As part of the settlement, it was decided to reverse the shop’s mortgage deed, a task entrusted to the lawyer. The victim paid her the required amount for the legal process, but she failed to obtain the necessary approvals, making it impossible to finalise the documentation. When he requested a refund, she refused to return the money. Meanwhile, the loan shark allegedly demanded an additional ₹8 lakh, which ultimately drove him to take the drastic step.",ahmedabad

So, how can you protect yourself and your loved ones from getting struck by sunstroke? We provide you with a detailed breakdown. But first, what is a sunstroke or a heatstroke? . When the body overheats as a result of extended exposure to high temperatures and dehydration, it causes headache, dizziness and confusion. This condition known as heatstroke needs emergency care. If it is not treated right away, it can have serious long-term side effects, such as harm to the kidneys, heart, brain, and muscles. Signs to be aware of: An abrupt increase in body temperature (104°F/40°C or more) Severe headaches, nausea, and vomiting Heavy breathing and heart rate rising Dizziness, fainting, and trouble moving Hot, red skin, excessive perspiration, or none at all Seizures, disorientation, or weakness Seek medical attention right away if you or someone close to you exhibits any of these symptoms. Tips to prevent heatstroke 1. Remain hydrated: Even if you don’t feel thirsty, continue drinking water throughout the day. 2. Dress well: To stay cool, wear loose-fitting, light clothing. 3. Prevent sunburn: Wear sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and sunscreen with an SPF of 50+ and a PA rating of PA+++ or higher. 4.

Adjust gradually: Allow your body to get used to the heat, particularly when you're exercising. 6. Remain inside or in the shade: Refrain from going outside between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., when sunlight is at its strongest. Look for shade and take frequent breaks from the sun if you must be outside.

According to the complaint filed at the Gujarat University Police Station by Nirav Mishbhai Patel, a resident of Naroda, accused Dream Peer Destination Holidays and its proprietors Jaymin Bhuwa and Darshana Bhuwa of criminal conspiracy and cheating. The complainant alleged that the duo collected ₹4.54 lakh from him and 21 other family members in 2024 for a Diwali vacation package to Goa but failed to honour their commitments. As per police, Patel was lured by the company’s advertisement on Social Media, which offered an attractive package covering travel, accommodation, sightseeing, and meals. Convinced by the offer, the family paid the full amount in instalments to the company’s account. The payments included ₹50,000 initially, followed by ₹1.70 lakh, and finally ₹3.39 lakh — totalling ₹4.54 lakh. On October 30, 2024, the family flew to Goa via an Indigo flight arranged by the company and checked into the Old Bender Resort as per the package. However, their holiday took a dramatic turn the very next day when the resort manager informed them that DYD Holidays (another name the company used) had not cleared any payments except a token amount. The resort demanded immediate payment of ₹65,000 or threatened eviction. Caught off-guard,  Patel and his family contacted Darshana Bhuwa, who promised to resolve the issue. She made a partial payment allowing them to stay until 3 November 2024. However, the final hotel bill of ₹1.33 lakh remained unpaid, and to make matters worse, their return flight tickets were abruptly cancelled by the company without prior notice. With no other option,  Patel arranged fresh flight tickets for all 21 family members at his own expense. Upon returning to Ahmedabad,  Patel confronted the company owners, who initially issued cheques totalling ₹2.21 lakh as reimbursement but the cheques bounced. Despite repeated attempts, neither Jaymin Bhuwa nor Darshana Bhuwa returned the money. The Gujarat University police have registered a case under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for cheating, criminal breach of trust, and criminal conspiracy and have started an investigation into the matter.",ahmedabad

A recent incident in Ahmedabad’s Kubernagar saw a 15-year-old learning to drive an XUV accidentally press the accelerator instead of the brake, leading to a fatal accident. Over the past year, Gujarat has recorded 727 accidents caused by underage drivers, averaging nearly two accidents per day. In 2023-24, Tamil Nadu topped the list of states with the highest number of underage driving accidents, recording 2,063 cases, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Gujarat ranks seventh in this list. Experts believe that the rise in such accidents is not solely the fault of minors but also of their parents, who encourage them to drive at an early age. Many parents allow their teenagers to ride two-wheelers as soon as they enter adolescence, and some even begin teaching them to drive cars. While traffic police conduct awareness drives near schools and tuition classes occasionally, there is a need for a more consistent and rigorous campaign to curb underage driving. According to Section 199A of the Motor Vehicles Act, if an accident is caused by an underage driver, the parents or vehicle owner can be held responsible. They may face up to three years in prison and a fine of ₹25,000.

Out of the 53,851 recognised schools in Gujarat, 6,332 schools lack even basic playground facilities. Among the 33,000 government primary schools, 5,000 schools do not have playgrounds. Additionally, out of approximately 12,700 secondary and higher secondary schools, 78 government schools, 315 grant-in-aid schools, and 255 private schools lack playgrounds. Many of these 255 schools operate within commercial complexes, where students must pass by shops and business establishments on their way to and from school. However, this does not mean the remaining 47,519 schools have adequate playgrounds. In many cases, small open spaces or plots have been officially designated as playgrounds, even if they do not meet the required standards. In 2018, the Gujarat government made it mandatory for new schools to have a designated playground, with a commitment that 40% of schools would implement this rule. However, there is still uncertainty about whether these schools have developed playgrounds. According to education experts, Gujarat government regulations require every school to have a playground. As per the Urban and Regional Development Plans Formulation and Implementation Guidelines, a school’s playground should occupy 30% to 40% of the total school area. A school with 500 students should have an open space of 2,000-3,000 square meters, allowing each child at least 4-6 metres for outdoor activities and a running distance of 100-200 meters. However, in cities like Ahmedabad and Surat, many schools operate inside commercial complexes, making it difficult to provide proper playgrounds. In some cases, the lack of space even affects traffic flow, as students must navigate busy roads and staircases during school hours. Numerous schools in Ahmedabad’s Ghatlodia, Naranpura, Bhuyangdev, Satellite, Amraiwadi, Odhav, Naroda, Nikol, Gomtipur, and Bapunagar operate without playgrounds, inside commercial complexes or along main roads. In such schools, students are either taken to rented playgrounds or only engage in sports activities on paper, without real participation.

Calling it ""not only unacceptable but shameful"", the court also ordered him to perform community service for two weeks. Dhaval Patel, who was attending the virtual hearing on February 17, initially connected to the proceedings but later got disconnected. When he rejoined, he was in a washroom, and the video of this incident went viral on the internet. Following this, a complaint was filed at Sola police station, after which the Gujarat High Court took the matter seriously. Justice M K Thakker called the act indecent and unacceptable, especially considering that Patel is a BSc graduate and an employee of a private company. The judge emphasised that such misconduct cannot be tolerated. Keeping this in mind, the court imposed a fine of ₹2,00,000 and instructed Patel to report to court every day at 10 am. He is required to report to a special officer and clean gardens for two weeks under supervision. The court directed that ₹50,000 should be deposited in Shishu Gruh Paldi, while the remaining amount should be transferred to the Gujarat High Court Legal Aid Services Authority. The defence argued that the incident was an unintentional mistake. However, Justice Thakker rejected this argument, stating that “a 42-year-old B Sc graduate working in the Reliance Group cannot claim ignorance regarding the operation of virtual hearing applications. The court further stated that such an indecent act is not only unacceptable but also shameful and must be strictly condemned. If courts do not take strict action against such behavior, it could lower the dignity of the judicial system in the eyes of the public.”",ahmedabad

Following the submission of the chargesheet, six accused who are currently in jail had applied for bail, but their petitions were rejected by the court. The court ruled that the accused were actively involved in the scam, which was a systematic and well-planned conspiracy to defraud innocent investors of their money. Citing the seriousness of the crime, the court denied bail, stating that granting it would not be appropriate. During the hearing, prosecutor Pravin Trivedi opposed the bail plea, arguing that the BZ Group orchestrated a large-scale scam involving ₹422.96 crore from 11,183 investors. Out of this amount, ₹172 crore is still pending for repayment to 6,866 investors and argued that no accused should be given bail.

Young, unemployed men from major cities across states were hired under false pretenses and their names used to open bank accounts for illegal financial operations. The scam came to light when a man from Ahmedabad received an ₹18 crore income tax notice. Shailesh Khunt, a resident of Vithalnagar, near Vidyaniketan School in Nikol, Ahmedabad, recently received an income tax notice of ₹18.53 crore for financial transactions conducted between 2021 and 2023. As per the notice, he was asked to provide transaction details via the tax portal by March 19, 2025. Failure to do so may result in penalties under the Income Tax Act of 1961, he was  told. He was also asked to submit copies of his income tax returns, profit-loss accounts, balance sheets, audit reports, and details of foreign currency transactions. If there are overseas direct investments, he must provide RBI-approved documentation. How the scam was perpetrated? The fraudsters set up offices in Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Gandhidham, and major cities of Maharashtra. They then hired unemployed youths, opened bank accounts in their names, and conducted massive monetary transactions with domestic and international banks and companies. The fraudsters bought SIM cards in the names of these young recruits and used documents such as PAN cards and Aadhaar cards to open bank accounts. These accounts were then operated online to conduct financial transactions worth crores across banks and companies in India and abroad. The scam was executed between 2021 and 2023. Little did the unemployed youngsters know that they were also appointed as ‘directors’ or ‘managing directors’ of fake companies. Using their identities, fraudulent bank accounts were opened, and large-scale financial transactions were conducted in their names. Key suspects in the case Reports suggest that the masterminds behind this scam include Vinod Hiramani Shinde, Sajid Ali Yusuf Ali Ansari, Deepak Katha, Bhagwandas Sahu, and Sujoy Banerjee from Mumbai. Several companies were set up in Vadodara, where crores of rupees were transacted through the bank accounts of individuals like Sunil Bhalekar, Shailesh Khunt, and Sharad Kadam in both Indian and international banks. Sunil Bhalekar, a resident of Natraj Township, Sayajiganj, filed a complaint with the police commissioner, revealing shocking details about the fraud. He said, “My friend owns a small pan shop near his flat, where we spent time. That’s where we met Mukesh Roy and Vinod Shinde, who frequented the shop. Over time, we became friends. One day, on a holiday, Mukesh Roy invited me for a meeting and tempted me with an offer to earn ₹25,000–₹35,000 per month.” “Trusting them, I handed over my Aadhaar card and PAN card. They then asked me to sign bank forms and company documents,” he added. Later, they opened an office under the name ‘Golden Globe Overseas’ near Akshar Chowk and ran it for a few months before suddenly shutting it down and disappearing to Mumbai. A few months later, Bhalekar received a call from the bank, asking for GST payment records. That’s when he realised that he had been scammed, and his documents were misused for illegal transactions worth crores.

Justice J C Doshi, while increasing the compensation for a minor who suffered paraplegia (paralysis of the lower limbs) due to a severe accident, emphasised that the tribunal must assess the impact of disability on the victim’s potential income and earning capacity rather than just relying on medical certification. The court ruled that the tribunal is responsible for conducting a thorough evaluation of functional disability and cannot base its decision solely on a doctor’s certificate. The court further noted that the minor suffered paraplegia due to the accident. Referring to relevant Supreme Court judgments, the court reiterated that evaluating functional disability is mandatory for the tribunal. The court observed that the tribunal failed to recognise the full impact of upper-body paralysis, which has left the child incapable of leading a normal life. Due to the severity of the accident, the 5-year-old victim’s life was permanently altered, causing immense suffering. The court emphasised that the child suffered 50% physical disability, but 100% functional disability, making him completely incapable of working in the future. The tribunal’s decision to consider only 50% disability for income loss assessment was incorrect, requiring modification of its conclusions. The High Court revised the tribunal’s initial order and increased the compensation to ₹13,09,240, instructing the insurance company to deposit the amount within six weeks with 9% annual interest. The case dates back to a 2002 accident, in which the victim’s father died, and the 5-year-old child suffered severe head and bodily injuries, leading to paraplegia. The victim initially claimed ₹15 lakh in compensation from the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, but the tribunal only awarded ₹2.25 lakh. Dissatisfied with the decision, the minor, through his guardian, appealed to the Gujarat High Court, which ruled in his favour.",ahmedabad

Based on a tip-off, the Zone-7 DCP squad apprehended Chirag Nareshbhai Kadiya, 32, near the VS Hospital. Originally from Vav village and the resident of Isanpur, Ahmedabad, Kadiya was found to be renting out bank accounts under different individuals' names. A detailed interrogation of Kadiya led to the registration of cases against a total of five individuals involved in renting out bank accounts for cyber fraud and other unauthorised financial transactions. Ahmedabad police registered a case against Snehal Solanki, Mukesh Daiya alias Sam Thakkar, and Gopal Prajapati. Kadiya earned a ₹10,000 commission for setting up bank accounts. Solanki recruited individuals willing to rent out accounts, Daiya provided pre-activated SIM cards, and Sam coordinated money transfers to Dubai through an angadia network. During Kadiya’s arrest, police seized: 52 passbooks and cheque books from various banks Over 45 Debit and credit cards Over 30 SIM cards QR codes from 15 banks Three bank card-swiping machines Modus operandi The accused deceived innocent citizens into providing their PAN and Aadhaar cards to create fake bank accounts and companies since October 2024. The gang created five fake companies – Satyam Enterprise, Shivay Enterprise, Prajapati Trading, Rupal Enterprise, and Radhe Enterprise – to launder money across eight states, including Gujarat, Haryana, Delhi, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gurugram, Assam, and Uttarakhand. Cybercrime branches from these states are now investigating the financial trail. On the orders of Solanki, Kadiya used to open fake bank accounts, which were registered under enterprise names with rented offices as a front, pretending to trade in sarees and grains. Kadiya used WhatsApp calls to communicate with Sam in Dubai. Daiya provided SIM cards for ₹1,200 each to facilitate net banking under fake identities. The bank account kits and SIM cards were then sent to Solanki, who forwarded them to  Sam in Dubai. Kadiya frequently withdrew money via checks or ATMs and also transferred funds using the angadia network. One of the victims, Shalin Rajendrakumar Goenka from Bodakdev, was targeted in an online stock and gold trading scam in July 2024, losing ₹7 lakh.

The fine was issued due to delays in filing a revision petition related to the case. The court had earlier dismissed Kejriwal and Singh’s request to hold separate trials, following which they filed a revision petition in the sessions court. However, there was a delay of over 300 days in filing this petition, leading the court to impose the fine while granting their request for delay exemption. During the hearing, Public Prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt strongly opposed their request, arguing that the delay in filing the revision petition was unjustified. Kejriwal and Singh are facing a criminal defamation case in Ahmedabad, with the magistrate court initially issuing summons for their appearance first in 2023.

The sport has become a social and fitness phenomenon in the city, quickly replacing late-night hangouts like café visits with a healthier, more active alternative. Blending elements of table tennis, lawn tennis, badminton, and squash, it has gained immense popularity across all age groups. It’s easy to learn and with minimal technical requirements, it has become the go-to activity for residents looking to stay fit while having fun with friends. With over 50 pickleball facilities across the city, Ahmedabad has fully embraced the trend. Many courts offer international-standard amenities, attracting growing crowds. Rates at these facilities range from ₹300 to ₹2,000 per hour, with more affordable options in the morning and afternoon. The courts typically remain open 24/7, with the majority of people preferring to play after 9 pm, when the social scene is at its peak. Trushit Thakar, an avid player, shared how pickleball reignited his passion for sports, “I played sports before 8 years and that was cricket, one of my friends invited me to play pickleball. Now, for the past one-and-half years this is the only sport that has got me excited about playing and then age has no bar. You don’t need any technique. If you are not a player, just step into the game and you are good to go. Post-Covid being healthy is important, so playing sports has always been a part of a healthy lifestyle and if you have good friends around you, you are good to go.” Roop Patel, a real estate developer, mentioned how pickleball has boosted his energy levels, “We play at night, and in the morning, we feel refreshed. It’s a great way to kickstart the day.” Sameer Singh, co-owner of Vista, a popular pickleball facility, pointed out the growing demand for the sport, “There are over 50 facilities now, and most people prefer playing after 9 pm. With no pubs around, pickleball has become the ideal activity for people to chill and hang out with friends. It’s simple, social, and a great way to unwind.” While Shenal Jhaveri, one of the partners of Shaishya Pulse Arena, shed light on how the sport is not limited to any age groups, driving the point by saying, “Yesterday we had a ten-year-old, and the day before we had a person who was 65, probably 70 years old.” This surge in pickleball’s popularity reflects a broader shift in Ahmedabad’s social scene, where the game is now a core part of the city’s lifestyle, offering both fitness benefits and an active way to connect with others.

The court has ruled that the benefits of the General Provident Fund (GPF) will only be applicable for the period of service after April 1, 1982. A division bench of Justice A S Supehia and Justice Nisha M Thakore overturned the decision of a single judge, which had previously ruled that retired employees were entitled to GPF benefits from their initial appointment date. This ruling by the high court is expected to impact thousands of retired government employees in the state. Reduction of over ₹600 cr financial burden of govt The high court gave this verdict while upholding the state’s Letters Patent Appeal. The key legal issue before the court was whether retired employees—most of whom retired before 2006—were entitled to receive GPF benefits from their initial appointment date. The court took special note of the fact that many employees who received promotions after 1982 had opted to consider their new appointment for availing GPF benefits under the government scheme. However, after several years, the same employees changed their stance and demanded that their entire tenure, from their initial appointment, be counted under the GPF scheme. Some of these appointments date back as far as 1965. The court observed that such claims by retired employees were contradictory, unfair, and unreasonable. Experts believe that this landmark judgment by the Gujarat HC will help save the state treasury over ₹600 crore. The ruling has significantly reduced the financial burden on the government. Representing the government, Advocate General Gursharan Singh Virk referred to a 2015 High Court judgment to resolve the legal dilemma. He argued that the retired employees’ stance was inconsistent—they wanted their promotions to be considered as fresh appointments for one purpose, while demanding GPF benefits for their entire service tenure from the original appointment date. The 2015 judgment had already clarified this issue, stating that GPF benefits are applicable only for service rendered after 1982, whereas pre-1982 service can only be considered for pension calculations. The retired employees had initially accepted GPF benefits under certain eligibility criteria, but they were now attempting to revoke their earlier choice and claim benefits from their appointment date. The high court ruled that such a demand was impractical and against the principles of natural justice.",ahmedabad

Six members of the cyber fraud gang have been arrested for duping unsuspecting merchants by manipulating their banking details under the pretext of Paytm service fee waivers. Modus operandi As per officials, fraudsters posed as Paytm representatives and approached shopkeepers with Paytm sound boxes, falsely claiming that monthly service charges of ₹89 had now been waived. By gaining the shopkeeper’s trust, they convinced them to initiate a ₹1 transaction from their banking app to verify the waiver. During this process, the fraudsters accessed the victims’ PIN and proceeded to siphon large sums of money from their accounts. In one such case, a complaint was lodged by Javerabhai Himmatlal Desai at the Cyber Crime police station, detailing how two unidentified persons fraudulently withdrew ₹5.99 lakh from his Bank of Baroda account by gaining access to his banking credentials. Investigation and arrests Acting under the directives, a special investigative team utilised advanced technical analysis and human intelligence to track down and apprehend the suspects on March 29 . The following individuals were arrested— Govind Lalchand Chogaji Patik (23) – resident of Shahpur, originally from Jaipur, Rajasthan. Brijesh Girishbhai Dabhai Patel (30) – resident of Ranip, originally from Mehsana district. Parag alias Ravi Laxmanbhai Ganesharamji Mistry (24) – resident of Juna Vadaj, originally from Sirohi, Rajasthan.

Pitam Sao Mikalal Kanji Suthar (26) – Resident of Pali, Rajasthan. Police recovered multiple mobile phones, SIM cards, and ₹25,500 in cash during the operation. Mastermind and operations Investigations revealed that Brijesh Patel, a former Paytm employee, was the mastermind behind the scam. After being dismissed from Paytm in 2022 due to fraudulent activities, he formed a gang with other former employees and began targeting shopkeepers in Ahmedabad and other districts in Gujarat. Initially, the gang used their knowledge of Paytm’s internal processes to deceive shopkeepers and extract their banking credentials. They later expanded their operations by recruiting additional members to help collect and launder money, using illegal online gaming accounts to funnel stolen funds and obtaining fraudulent SIM cards and bank accounts to cover their tracks. Cyber Crime police's advice to the public The Ahmedabad Cyber Crime Branch has issued a public advisory urging individuals to take the following precautions: - Do not trust unknown individuals claiming to represent Paytm or any banking service. - Never share banking credentials, PINs, or OTPs with strangers. - Verify the identities of service representatives before providing any details. - Monitor bank statements and SMS alerts regularly for suspicious transactions. - Report fraud immediately to the Cyber Crime Helpline at 1930 or visit the nearest police station. Investigation underway Authorities believe this gang has committed similar frauds across Surendranagar, Limdi, Bagodara, Palanpur, Adalaj, and other regions of Gujarat, involving sums ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹6,00,000. The Cyber Crime Branch is continuing its investigation to track other accomplices and recover the defrauded amounts.",ahmedabad

The 1,800 constables who are serving as Head Constables or assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) had demanded salaries as per the 10-20-30 year promotion rules. However, the Gujarat Police has now made it mandatory for them to clear the examination if they want the salary of a PSI. Discontent has been brewing internally within the police force over the Gujarat government’s policies on promotions. According to old resolutions passed by the government, police personnel were to receive higher pay scales upon completion of 10, 20, and 30 years of service. Consequently, around 1,800 Gujarat police personnel who were recruited as constables in 1991 and 1996-97 and have completed 30 years of service had demanded higher pay at the PSI level. A total of 650 police personnel have even submitted applications to the director general of police (DGP)'s office regarding this matter. In this context, the administrative department of the Gujarat Police issued a circular four days ago stating that constable staff who have been receiving ASI pay for three years and desire to obtain the higher pay scale of a Class-3 PSI should submit their application forms to appear for the mode-3 departmental examination.

The councillor alleges that  toilet cleaning has been consistently neglected in three wards of the central zone over the past year, despite a sum of ₹57.24 lakh being paid for the service. A request has been made to the municipal commissioner to recover this amount. Since no cleaning work has been observed in public toilets, a vigilance investigation has also been requested. Demand to recover cost for cleaning 115 public toilets As per information provided by AMC, public toilets in the central zone have been cleaned only four times in the past four years, alleged Councillor Rafiq Sheikh of Jamalpur. Sheikh alleged that public money is being wasted due to the collusion between AMC officials. A total of ₹216 crore has been spent on toilet cleaning in the Jamalpur ward.

Currently, more than 250 domestic and international flights operate daily at Ahmedabad airport. Around 10,000 domestic and international passengers travel from the airport every day. Birds and monkeys frequent the runway during takeoffs, increasing the risk of strikes. Notably, if a bird collides with a flight during takeoff, an emergency landing may be required, and engineers must inspect the aircraft before it can take off again. To prevent such dangers, ground staff have been deployed 24/7 to ensure no major accidents occur. These personnel continuously set off firecrackers round the clock. An estimate suggests that firecrackers worth ₹15 lakh to 20 lakh are used every month before a flight takes off. The continuous bursting of firecrackers throughout the day leads to the dispersion of smoke across the airport. Between January and December last year, five to seven bird strike incidents were recorded. However, since the firecrackers have been used, no such incidents have occurred.

"Toll tax on State, national highways increased by 5-15%",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/toll-tax-on-state-national-highways-increased-by-5-15-per-cent,2025-04-01,1,04,2025,"With the onset of the new financial year, both the Central and state governments, including the Gujarat government, have burdened citizens with a hike in toll taxes. The toll tax on roads such as Ahmedabad to Mehsana, Shamlaji to Godhra has been increased by an average of 14.55%. Similarly, the toll on roads like Halol and Shamlaji has also been raised. The highest increase has been observed on the Vadodara-Halol road and the Adalaj-Mehsana road. The toll tax on the road from Sarkhej to Maliya has been increased by approximately 5% to 15%. For various categories of vehicles, the toll at booths between Ahmedabad and Maliya has increased by ₹5 to ₹15. The toll for two-axle vehicles on the Dahej-Bharuch route has been raised from ₹230 to ₹250, while for three-axle vehicles, it has increased from ₹250 to ₹260. Similarly, the toll for earthmovers has gone up from ₹380 to ₹400, and for vehicles with more than seven axles, the toll has been increased from ₹460 to ₹480. On the Vadodara-Halol 31.7 km stretch, even after the toll collection period had ended, a 14.55% increase has been imposed. This toll has been collected since the road was built in 2001, and despite the collection exceeding the initial investment, the toll continues. The Vadodara-Halol toll road was built at a cost of ₹170.64 crore, while the Adalaj-Mehsana 51.6 km road, built at a cost of ₹344.25 crore, has been under toll collection since 2003. The total cost for both roads was ₹514.89 crore. Toll rates on these roads are higher than those set for National Highways. According to RTI (Right to Information) data, by 2023-24, a total of ₹2,928 crore had been collected from these tolls, yet another ₹1,968 crore is still being claimed as recoverable. Out of the collected amount, the company has made a profit of ₹1,954 crore, paid ₹652 crore in dividends to its shareholders, and still increased the toll by 14.55% from April 1, 2025. Even after full recovery, the government continues to increase toll fees. The Gujarat government holds a 16% stake in the company operating these toll roads, raising concerns that the state is prioritising profits over public welfare. Toll hike on Bagodara-Tarapur Road On the Bagodara-Tarapur road, toll rates have increased as follows: Light commercial vehicles: From ₹110 to ₹115 Buses: From ₹220 to ₹235 Three-axle vehicles: From ₹240 to ₹250 SCM vehicles: From ₹370 to ₹390 Seven-axle vehicles: From ₹445 to ₹465 On the Halol-Shamlaji road, the toll has been increased as follows: Motor-Jeep: From ₹230 to ₹2545 (likely a typo or miscalculation in original data) Minibus: From ₹410 to ₹445 Bus: From ₹805 to ₹885 Light commercial vehicles: From ₹410 to ₹445 Two-axle vehicles: From ₹805 to ₹885 Multiple-axle vehicles: From ₹1295 to ₹1425 This increase has been confirmed by Nimesh Patel, the secretary of the Truck Transport Association. Increase of ₹800 to ₹900 per Trip on National Highways The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has six toll booths between Karjan and Mumbai, where tolls have been increased by ₹5, ₹15, and ₹25 per booth. Shockingly, the NHAI’s 2008 notification states that once a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project recovers its cost (including interest), only 40% of the original toll rate should be charged for maintenance. However, the government has ignored this regulation and increased toll fees even on these roads. As a result, heavy vehicles now bear an additional cost of ₹800 to ₹900 per trip, according to Mukesh Dave, the Executive President of the All Gujarat Truck Transport Association. New toll rates on Ahmedabad-Maliya Road On the Ahmedabad-Maliya route, toll tax has been increased from Sarkhej to Dhrangadhra, Dhrangadhra to Halvad, and Halvad to Maliya. The new toll rates vary for cars, jeeps, minibuses, buses, LCVs, and two-axle trucks. Minibus Sarkhej - Viramgam: ₹120 Viramgam - Dhrangadhra: ₹165 Dhrangadhra - Halvad: ₹65 Halvad - Maliya: ₹100 Bus Sarkhej - Viramgam: ₹235 Viramgam - Dhrangadhra: ₹330 Dhrangadhra - Halvad: ₹130 Halvad - Maliya: ₹195 Light commercial vehicle Sarkhej - Viramgam: ₹120 Viramgam - Dhrangadhra: ₹165 Dhrangadhra - Halvad: ₹65 Halvad - Maliya: ₹100 Two-axle truck Sarkhej - Viramgam: ₹235 Viramgam - Dhrangadhra: ₹150 Dhrangadhra - Halvad: ₹310 Halvad - Maliya: ₹195 Multiple axle truck Sarkhej - Viramgam: ₹375 Viramgam - Dhrangadhra: ₹240 Dhrangadhra - Halvad: ₹500 Halvad - Maliya: ₹320 Toll for cars and jeeps Sarkhej - Viramgam: ₹65 Viramgam - Dhrangadhra: ₹95 Dhrangadhra - Halvad: ₹35 Halvad - Maliya: ₹55 Also read: Toll tax hike in Ahmedabad from April 1: NHAI increases fees across key highways",ahmedabad
Ahmedabad to host AICC national convention after 64 years,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-to-host-aicc-national-convention-after-64-years,2025-04-01,1,04,2025,"Ahmedabad is gearing up to host the 84th National Convention of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) on April 8-9, marking a historic return of the event to Gujarat after a gap of 64 years. The high-profile gathering, set against the scenic backdrop of the Sabarmati Riverfront, will witness the presence of nearly 3,000 Congress leaders, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, senior leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, and KC Venugopal. Gujarat last hosted an AICC convention in 1961 in Bhavnagar, making this a politically significant event for the Congress party in the state. With the Lok Sabha elections on the horizon, the gathering is expected to set the stage for key political discussions and strategic planning. With top Congress leaders staying in the city for two days, the party has made extensive accommodation arrangements, booking around 2,000 hotel rooms across Ahmedabad and nearby areas. Prominent hotels, including ITC Narmada and Courtyard Marriott, have been fully reserved. At the same time, other high-end properties such as Hyatt, The Fern, Fortune Landmark, Lemon Tree, Rivera, and Radisson Blu have also been secured for delegates. To facilitate seamless transportation, the party has arranged a fleet of cars and buses, with additional vehicle support from party workers if required. Congress has also tied up with private travel agencies and hotel transport services to accommodate any last-minute logistical needs. Such large-scale hotel reservations are typically seen during international cricket matches or high-profile concerts, but this time, political activity has driven the surge in demand. Given that the convention will be held at the Sabarmati Riverfront and the Sardar Patel Memorial, Congress has ensured that all nearby accommodations are exclusively booked for its attendees. The Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) is currently navigating a complex political landscape, marked by internal challenges and external pressures. In the 2022 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, the Indian National Congress (INC) faced a significant defeat, securing only 17 out of 182 seats, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) maintained its dominance in the state. ​ In recent developments, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, during his visit to Gujarat on March 6 and 7, 2025, accused a faction within the state party of “conspiring with the BJP.” He emphasised the need for organisational restructuring and indicated that the party should be prepared to remove “20 to 30 people” if necessary to strengthen its position in the state. The absence of veteran leader Ahmed Patel, who passed away in 2020, has been deeply felt within the GPCC. Patel was instrumental in bridging the gap between the central and state leadership, and his demise has led to a noticeable void in strategic coordination.

Now, adding a fresh rhythm to this ever-evolving landscape is Ahmedabad Jamming Cult (AJC) – a first-of-its-kind open music community where local artistes can showcase their talent, collaborate, and create unforgettable musical experiences. Started by Ritesh Vishwakarma, a corporate worker, vocalist, and a native of Nepal, AJC has quickly become a go-to destination for music lovers in Ahmedabad who crave authentic, raw, and soulful performances. Self-taught vocalist’s vision Ritesh Vishwakarma is not just the founder of AJC but also a passionate vocalist who learned music from his mother and internet, flourishing without any professional training. His journey proves that dedication and raw passion can shape an artist, and this belief became the foundation of AJC – a platform where anyone with talent can perform, regardless of their background or experience. Ahmedabad’s first-of-its-kind jamming cult AJC is the first-ever jamming cult in Ahmedabad, offering a unique and organic platform for musicians to perform, collaborate, and connect in an open, welcoming environment. Unlike conventional music platforms, AJC is completely free and takes place mostly every weekend at the scenic Sabarmati Riverfront. A stage without boundaries What makes AJC truly special is that it is a stage without boundaries – an open, inclusive space where artistes can share their talent without restrictions. There are no tickets, no formalities, and no judgment – just pure music, raw performances, and a community of people who love the art. The idea behind AJC started as an experiment. Vishwakarma, along with his friend, decided to jam outside Abhivyakti, an art festival in Ahmedabad, right in the parking lot. The response which they received there was overwhelming. Seeing the enthusiasm of passersby who stopped to listen, they realised they need to streamline and create a stage for people to connect more. From that moment, they took the idea to the Sabarmati Riverfront, a place where people come to unwind, reflect, and now – enjoy live music. Started near the end of December 2024, now within just three months, AJC has grown into a recognised platform, drawing an increasing number of artistes and attendees every weekend. Social media buzz has further fuelled its rise, making it one of Ahmedabad’s most exciting places for music lovers. Music scene for everyone AJC welcomes all kinds of music – Bollywood classics, retro tunes, indie music, and even experimental sounds. The goal is simple: to create an experience where music lovers feel connected and artists feel encouraged. There’s no competition, only collaboration. Platform created by artiste, for artistes For those who have always wanted to perform but never had a stage, AJC is the perfect opportunity. Whether you’re a seasoned performer or someone just starting their musical journey, AJC offers a space where talent is appreciated and music is celebrated. So, if you’re in Ahmedabad and looking for something fresh, exciting, and musical, head to the riverfront weekend and experience AJC for yourself. What does artistes have to say about AJC? Gujarat Samachar Digital spoke with artistes after their performances at the Ahmedabad Jamming Cult (AJC) session this Sunday at Riverfront House. Many artistes shared how these sessions have become a source of solace, personal growth, and creative expression for them. Founder’s take Ritesh Vishwakarma, the founder of AJC, told GS Digital that he created this platform for artistes who want to showcase their talent but lack opportunities. “My goal with AJC is clear – to create a platform for artistes in Ahmedabad. Anyone and everyone is welcome here. It’s also for audiences who cannot afford concerts or simply want to enjoy music freely. AJC is for them,” he said. A passionate journey for music Abhi Purohit, a keys player, vocalist, and project engineer from Anand, travels to Ahmedabad every weekend solely for the jamming session. “I come here to showcase my talent and enjoy the vibe. I first learned about AJC through social media, got in touch with them, and now make sure to plan my schedule accordingly to be here every weekend,” he said. As a working professional, he doesn’t get much time to indulge in his passion for music, but these sessions provide him with an escape. “Singing here and putting my soul into music is the best part. Seeing people enjoy our performances makes it even more special,” he added. A platform for learning and growth Aakash, who performs under the stage name ‘Scy’, is a trained classical singer and a working professional. He appreciates how AJC provides a welcoming space for artistes. “It’s a great opportunity to connect with people and experiment with new ideas. It’s both a learning experience and an enjoyable one. Performing here before a live audience has helped me build confidence and grow as an artiste,” he shared. Music as a catalyst for healing Ajeenkya Nath, a guitarist, vocalist, and HR manager from Udaipur, has been in Ahmedabad for the past four months to care for his hospitalised sister. For him, music acts as a powerful catalyst, helping him express and connect with people. As the setlist and playlist curator at AJC, he ensures that each session flows smoothly and that everyone enjoys the experience. He first discovered AJC while struggling with depression. “One day, while walking along the riverfront, I saw a group of people playing guitar and jamming. It reignited my love for music, and I started playing with them. Now, for the past three months, I’ve been a part of this community, performing every weekend,” he said. Finding a home through music Gautami Mahaldar, an architect by profession and a vocalist from Karnataka, learned music from her mother. After moving to Ahmedabad for work, she initially struggled with the language barrier and felt isolated. However, one day while exploring the city, she stumbled upon the jamming session at the riverfront and immediately felt a connection. “Look at these people now; it has grown into a massive crowd attraction. I am a lead vocalist and have learned classical music, but I never thought I would be able to connect with people in this city. Now, my weekends are all about singing my heart out, and during the week, I focus on work,” she said. Through AJC, Gautami said that she has learned Gujarati songs, which she considers a personal achievement. “I have performed in Karnataka and Goa, but this is a completely new experience for me. If given the opportunity, I would love to pursue music professionally,” she added. These jamming sessions have become more than just musical gatherings; they are a space for artistes to express themselves, find healing, and build a supportive community in Ahmedabad. Audience reaction The jamming session starts with around 30 to 40 people and gradually grows to at least 100 by the end. The audience is highly engaging – they hype up the artistes and join in the experience. The jamming session at the riverfront has quickly become the real hype of Ahmedabad. A guy who recently moved back from Europe said, “This kind of jamming and showcasing talent is very common in Europe, but seeing it for the first time in Ahmedabad is interesting. It shows that the city is growing,” he shared.",ahmedabad

Over 32,000 retired employees are set to receive the benefit after a division bench of Justices A S Supehia and Nisha M Thakore ordered the state government to pay the retired employees one increment and arrears within six months, as per a Supreme Court judgment. Gujarat High Court finally disposed of many contempt petitions filed by retired employees. This order comes as a great relief to a long-standing legal dispute concerning one increment and its arrears of government employees. Following the Supreme Court’s order dated February 20, 2025, the high court had clearly instructed the state government to pay these benefits according to the categories determined by the Supreme Court and to ensure compliance. Representing the state government, Gursharan Singh Virk said that the Supreme Court has decided to give the benefit of an increment and arrears to the respective retired employees in three categories. According to the category determined by the Supreme Court, those retired employees who have not gone to court or filed a case will receive the benefit of one increment from May 1, 2023, or thereafter. However, in cases where retired government employees have filed court cases, they will benefit from the increment from the date they filed the case, as of February 20, 2025. The Gujarat HC also clarified in its order that only employees who have retired from statutory authorities and to whom the pension scheme is applicable, will get the benefit of one increment.

Ahmedabad cop accused of taking ₹2 lakh bribe from bootlegger to avoid PASA,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-cop-accused-of-taking-rs-2-lakh-bribe-from-bootlegger,2025-04-04,4,04,2025,"A constable at Chandkheda police station allegedly demanded a bribe of ₹5.30 lakh from an accused in a liquor case, in exchange for not initiating Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA) proceedings and not taking him to court. The ACB set up a trap and caught the constable’s aide red-handed accepting the bribe. The accused bootlegger involved in the sale of Indian-Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) was booked under PASA at Chandkheda police station. He was declared ‘wanted’ in the case. Constable Rajnish Shrimali was assigned to investigate the matter. Shrimali met the bootlegger and threatened to detain him under PASA due to his previous offences. He allegedly demanded ₹5.30 lakh to avoid taking action under PASA. Since the accused could only arrange ₹2 lakh, the constable asked him to deliver the money to Kanha Restaurant on New C G Road, Chandkheda, on Wednesday. The accused reported the matter to the ACB, which set up a trap. However, instead of accepting the money himself, Constable Shrimali sent his associate, a civilian named Mitul Gohil (from Chandkheda), to collect the bribe on his behalf. When Gohil received the money, the ACB arrested him. Meanwhile, Constable Shrimali, suspecting the trap, fled the scene. The ACB has launched an investigation in the matter, and is likely to check the call records of the accused constable.

According to the family, they were asleep when the child went missing. Upon waking, the parents noticed the baby was not in his place and began searching the surrounding area. Failing to locate him, they contacted the police. A search operation was promptly initiated by the Meghaninagar police, and within 5 hours, the infant’s lifeless body was discovered inside the water tank of the house. Given that the child could not walk or crawl, the circumstances surrounding how he ended up in the tank have raised serious concerns and suspicion of murder. At the time of the incident, only the child’s mother, Karishma, his father, Dilip Baghel, and his grandmother were present in the house. Police investigations have so far not uncovered any evidence of an outsider entering the premises. No neighbours reported seeing any suspicious activity or any unknown persons in the vicinity. According to preliminary accounts, the infant’s mother had briefly stepped away for 3 minutes to use the restroom, during which time the child disappeared. The father and grandmother were reportedly inside the house the entire time. Police are now thoroughly questioning all family members present during the critical time window. While the post-mortem report is awaited to determine the exact cause of death, the possibility of murder has not been ruled out. Investigators are exploring all angles and have intensified their inquiries into the household dynamics and potential motives. The case has gripped local residents and raised questions over the safety and vulnerability of children even within their own homes. Police officials have assured that a comprehensive investigation will be carried out and that justice will be delivered based on the findings.",ahmedabad

AMC to geo-tag 2.6 million properties using GIS tech,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/amc-to-geo-tag-2-6-million-properties-using-gis-tech,2025-04-05,5,04,2025,"Representative Image In a step toward smart city development, Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) will geo-tag over 2.6 million residential and commercial properties using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. The initiative aims to assign a unique identification number to each property within AMC limits, which accounts to 1.9 million residential and 6,50,000 commercial units. The project includes a city-wide drone survey to capture high-resolution images of properties. These images will be used to create digital maps, helping the AMC streamline services such as door-to-door waste collection, property tax, and fire safety monitoring. Each property will have a QR code installed, which sanitation workers must scan to confirm waste collection. Property data will be accessible digitally with a single click. AMC officials cited similar successful implementations in Varanasi and Goa, where GIS-based property mapping has improved governance. According to Standing Committee Chairman Devang Dani, the AMC  will issue a formal request for agencies to conduct surveys, take geo-tagged photographs, measure carpet areas, and link electricity and water connections digitally using existing tenement numbers. However, the move has drawn criticism from opposition leaders, who allege the ruling party is using the project for publicity. They argue that the administration is already struggling to address online complaints over 4,00,000 related to basic civic services that were filed in 2024–25 alone, many of which remain unresolved.

Police suspect that exam-related stress may have contributed to her decision. The student, identified as 21-year-old Sushila Vasava from Aravalli, had taken admission under the government quota. According to the police, she was alone in her hostel room on the night of the incident while her roommate was away. When the roommate returned around midnight, she found Sushila had taken her life using a ‘dupatta’. The authorities were immediately informed. No suicide note was found during the initial investigation. ACP M B Vadand stated that the student’s mobile phone is being examined, and her family and fellow students are being questioned as part of the inquiry. Initial findings suggest exam stress might have been a factor, but other possibilities are also being looked into. Sources at NHL Medical College mentioned that students are assigned mentors under the National Medical Council’s ‘Mentor-Mentee’ programme. These mentors meet with their assigned students every two to three months. Meetings with Sushila were conducted in December 2024 and February 2025, during which she reportedly did not express any concerns.

Congress Convention in Ahmedabad on April 8-9: Will the party in decline rekindle its legacy?,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/congress-convention-in-ahmedabad-will-the-party-in-decline-rekindle-its-legacy,2025-04-06,6,04,2025,"The Congress party is set to hold its national convention on April 8 and 9 in Ahmedabad. About 2,000 All India Congress Committee (AICC) delegates from across the country, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, senior party leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi and K C Venugopal, will arrive in Gujarat for the convention. Speeches will be held, resolutions will be passed, and two days of political discourse will ensue. All of this is to be expected, but the real question is whether this 2025 convention can do what the sessions held on the banks of the Sabarmati River in 1902 and 1921 once did—guide the nation in a new direction amid the challenges of their time. Can this gathering, if not for the country, at least give its workers a clear direction? Will it be successful in reviving the nearly lifeless state of the Congress in Gujarat? Back in 1985, the Congress created a record by winning 149 out of 182 seats in the Gujarat Assembly. Today, in 2025, the party doesn’t even have enough members to officially qualify as the opposition. Since 1990, the Congress has lost the strength to form a government on its own. It temporarily benefited from alliances with Chimanbhai Patel’s Gujarat Janata Dal and later with Shankarsinh Vaghela’s RJP, but these proved to be short-lived experiments. Since 1998, the Congress has had no real taste of power in Gujarat—a widely known fact. The party did win 76 seats in the 2017 election, but that was largely due to the Patidar reservation agitation. By 2022, it was back to square one, and defections only deepened its troubles. People often wonder—how did this happen? But the national and state-level Congress leadership seems uninterested in asking such questions. If they had been introspective, the current state of affairs might have been averted. Today, the leaders within the Gujarat Congress belong more to internal factions than to the party itself. None possess the stature or strength to lead the entire state. They are merely symbolic figures, propped up by central leadership in Delhi. The biggest flaw is that these leaders have no pulse on public sentiment. That’s why, despite issues like fear, hunger, corruption, unemployment, poor healthcare and education, Dalit and Adivasi oppression, women’s issues, and labour exploitation, not a single leader actively connects with the people. Those holding official positions focus solely on preserving them, making strategic moves to secure their circles. Worse yet, they maintain cosy relationships with ruling authorities and bureaucrats to keep their political shops running. Even today, roughly 30% of the electorate—mainly in rural areas—continues to support Congress. There is still some hopeful connection. But sadly, the leaders seem to have turned a blind eye. Much like their BJP counterparts, they too seem stuck in political mire. A political analyst in Gujarat commented, “Even the most advanced medical care cannot revive a patient who has lost the will to live.” The same is true for the Gujarat Congress. Thus, the upcoming convention on the Sabarmati might just be another ‘destination’ event. In 1924, Mahatma Gandhi led the Belgaum session and truly understood the pulse of the people, guiding the nation. A hundred years later, today’s Congress leaders—despite sharing his surname—are nowhere near capable of doing the same, even for Gujarat, let alone the country. While the Congress may challenge the BJP in its so-called ‘Gujarat Model’ by hosting a convention, the real question is whether it can use this platform to transform itself into a people-centric organisation.",ahmedabad

Tensions escalated when the police reportedly refused to grant permission for the procession to proceed with the contentious theme. As a result, VHP workers blocked the road in the Nikol area, sitting on the streets in protest. The blockade caused disruptions in traffic and drew a significant crowd, prompting additional police deployment to maintain order. According to sources, the Shobha Yatra was part of a religious procession planned in the Bapunagar locality. The inclusion of a tableau centred around the controversial 'Love Jihad' theme became a point of contention with law enforcement, who cited concerns over communal harmony and law & order. In response to the police's intervention, VHP activists sat in protest and initiated a chakkajam (road blockade), demanding that the yatra be allowed to proceed in its original form. Several leaders of the outfit were seen negotiating with police officials at the site. No incidents of violence were reported during the standoff, though tension remained high. Authorities stated that they are working to defuse the situation and resume normal traffic flow.

The woman, having recently discovered the video’s circulation nearly two-and-a half years after it was recorded, has lodged a formal complaint with the Rakhial police. According to police reports, the woman, who resides with her husband in Rakhial, had initially visited Juhapura for a relative’s wedding around two-and-a-half years ago. There, she befriended a man named Najimohmad Sultan Pathan. Their acquaintance soon blossomed into frequent mobile conversations, eventually leading to a romantic involvement. The man claimed he worked as a press reporter and was also affiliated with an NGO located in a shopping complex in Rakhial. Trusting his credentials, the woman confided in him about her financial woes—specifically, an amount of ₹2.7 lakh that was stuck with a builder who was refusing to return it. Believing that his NGO connections could help retrieve the money, she sought his assistance. Pathan then took the woman to the NGO office in Rakhial, where she was asked to deposit ₹5,000 as a token fee. Trustees and an advocate associated with the organisation assured her that she would recover the money within a week. However, when no updates were provided after the promised time frame, the woman returned to the NGO office seeking clarification. On that day, Sohrat Saiyed alias Sunny, advocate V A Shaikh, and Rafique Noori were present in the office. Shortly after, Pathan also arrived. While the couple were later spending private moments together, the NGO members allegedly recorded the incident on video. Shockingly, this footage was leaked on a social media group over two years later. The betrayal came to light recently, leaving the woman and Pathan stunned and distressed. They have since filed a police complaint against the three individuals named above at Rakhial police station. Police have registered a case and have launched further investigations into the matter.",ahmedabad

Did superstition play a role in the death of infant in Meghaninagar?,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/did-superstition-play-a-role-in-the-death-of-infant-in-meghaninagar,2025-04-07,7,04,2025,"In a deeply disturbing case that has sent shockwaves across Meghaninagar, the lifeless body of a three-month-old infant was discovered inside a water tank at his residence in Jay Ambe Nagar, Bhargav Road. The discovery came merely five hours after his parents reported him missing last Thursday morning. The infant, Khyal Baghel, was reportedly last seen sleeping beside his parents, Dilip and Karishma Baghel. Upon waking and realising the child was missing, the family initiated a frantic search before informing the Meghaninagar police. A prompt search operation led to the tragic discovery of the baby’s body inside the house’s water tank — an area deemed inaccessible to a child of his age, incapable of crawling or walking. Police have since registered a case and launched a full-scale investigation. The fact that no signs of forced entry or evidence of any outsider have emerged has led authorities to suspect involvement from within the household. At the time of the incident, only the infant’s parents and grandmother were present at home. During initial interrogation, Karishma, the infant’s mother, claimed that the child might have accidentally fallen into the tank while she stepped away briefly to use the washroom. However, the police remain sceptical of this explanation, citing the implausibility of the baby reaching the tank unaided. In a significant development, investigators have now uncovered a disturbing new angle: the possible role of superstition in the tragedy. According to sources familiar with the probe, police have come across indications that the family harboured superstitious beliefs and had begun associating their recent misfortunes — including financial instability and deteriorating health — with the birth of the infant. “Preliminary findings suggest that the family believed their downfall began after the birth of the child,” a senior police official told Gujarat Samachar Digital . “We are exploring whether these beliefs played a role in the child’s death.” This revelation has further deepened suspicion that the act may have been deliberate rather than accidental. Investigators are now focusing on whether the family, driven by blind faith and desperation, may have chosen to eliminate the child in a misguided attempt to rid themselves of perceived misfortune. The post-mortem report, awaited at the time of reporting, is expected to shed light on the exact cause of death. Meanwhile, police are thoroughly questioning all family members and examining past behaviour, including any previous indications of neglect or distress linked to the child. Meghaninagar police have assured that “All aspects of the case are being looked into, including the influence of superstition. We are committed to uncovering the truth and ensuring justice is served,” said the investigating officer.",ahmedabad

The accused, identified by his nickname 'Jigo', is absconding. As per the FIR lodged at Satellite police station, the attack occurred around 11.30 pm on April 6, near Ruchi Pan Parlour, located close to the Neelkanth Mahadev Temple in Rajivnagar. The complainant, Kamleshbhai Kalubhai Aghera (30), who works as a daily-wage labourer, stated that he and his elder brother, Shaileshbhai Aghera (35), were assaulted by the accused with a knife he picked up from a nearby vegetable cart. As per the complaint, the brothers had gone out to chew pan masala after dinner. Jigo was standing near the parlour and asked them to fetch pan masala for him. When they told him to get it himself, he became enraged, used abusive language, and suddenly pulled a knife from a vegetable lorry and stabbed them Both brothers began bleeding heavily and screamed for help. The commotion attracted local residents, and emergency medical services were called. An ambulance arrived within minutes and transported the injured to Asarwa Civil Hospital, where they are undergoing treatment. The accused, who is known locally by the alias 'Jigo' and believed to be around 35 years old, fled the scene immediately after the attack.

The complainant has confirmed that he recognises the accused by face, though he does not know his full name.

Five cars and six-two wheelers parked near the house were charred in the huge fire. As per information, Jagdish Meghani owned the bungalow-cum-illegal storage godown. Meghani and his son Kartavya operated an air conditioning service centre. They stored AC repairing materials including compressor, copper wire, and highly combustible AC gas or refrigerant in the ground floor of their residence. Preliminary investigation revealed that the fire started due to a spark that would have quickly spread due to gas leakage. More than 1,300 cans of butane gas were stored in the house. The deceased were identified as Jagdish Meghani's wife Saraswati, who was said to be four months pregnant, and her 4-year-old son Soumya. They were on the first floor of the house, when the explosion took place on the ground floor around 3.15 pm on Sunday. The fire spread in minutes due to the presence of highly combustible materials on the ground floor. Chief Fire Officer Jayesh Khadiya rushed with his team to douse the fire. After around 1.5 hours, the fire was doused. The fire teams arrived again on Monday morning again to sprinkle water to douse the fire which was reignited. The woman is said to have died in the house, while Soumya was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. Upon receiving information about the incident, Deputy Commissioner of Police Zone-7 Shivam Verma, Assistant Commissioner of Police B M Vanand, and personnel at Vasna police station arrived at the scene and initiated an investigation into the entire incident. As per police sources, along with a case of accidental death, a case of negligence is likely to be registered against Kartavya Meghani. Owner ignored notice from society A letter dated February 13, 2024, was addressed to Jagdish Meghani by Gyanda housing society secretary Deepak Prajapati. It reads as follows, Regarding your use of house no 24, Gyanda society, as a godown, you are hereby informed that you should not keep any items in the bungalow compound; you should keep them inside your bungalow. Do not place them outside or on the roof of your compound. You are involved in the business of supplying various raw materials for air conditioners. You also keep AC gas cylinders in the compound, which poses a risk of fire. Therefore, to avoid inconvenience to the residents nearby and your family, please immediately remove the materials kept in the compound. Plan to keep the materials in the house in such a way that there is proper ventilation. If you are negligent in doing so, we will be forced to inform the corporation about this matter concerning the residential area. Only you will be responsible for any unexpected incident that occurs. Arrange the work in such a way that it does not cause inconvenience to yourself and those around you. You are hereby informed that if you do not remove the old materials from your compound within 7 days, we will take legal action.

Around 80% of those possessing firearms obtained through questionable means are gamblers and anti-social elements, an ongoing drive led by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and Special Operations Group (SOG) has found. Many individuals were found to have acquired gun licences from other states, primarily Delhi and Haryana, with the help of agents, bypassing local laws and scrutiny. Even prominent and influential figures have reportedly obtained licenses illegally. After Gujarat’s Director General of Police Vikas Sahay ordered a crackdown within 100 hours, operations intensified against those fuelling the gun culture. SOG teams across all districts, under ATS supervision, launched in-depth investigations into licenses acquired through agents from other states. The ATS and Ahmedabad Crime Branch are investigating states like Manipur, Meghalaya, and Nagaland, where gun licenses are allegedly obtained more easily. For instance, in Surendranagar district, 21 individuals were found in possession of 25 weapons and 216 cartridges—17 of whom admitted to obtaining licenses from Manipur and Nagaland via agents. Following similar patterns in other districts, ATS has compiled a list of 160 individuals for further investigation. The racket of obtaining licenses through agents from other states has reportedly been operating in an organised manner for decades. The scam has infiltrated cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Surendranagar, Morbi, Botad, and Jamnagar. The process involves spending lakhs of rupees to bypass rules and obtain licenses, mainly  through illicit players—around 80% of whom are considered anti-social elements, as per reports. These individuals often use out-of-state licenses to purchase guns and assert dominance. Sources reveal that it’s difficult to get a license within Gujarat, while northeastern states easily issue gun licences. These licenses often overlook background checks like criminal records with the Gujarat police. Active agent networks in Haryana, Delhi An active chain of agents also assist in gun purchases from Haryana and Delhi, as many arms dealers refuse to sell weapons based on out-of-state licenses. Furthermore, even elected officials are required by law to notify authorities if they change their address, but this rule is frequently flouted. While this is the third major drive in five years, no permanent solution seems to have been found yet. While ATS appears committed to strict action, questions are being raised about the secrecy surrounding the investigation. The agency has remained silent about the identities and details of some high-profile individuals involved, including celebrities, raising concerns over transparency. The racket of obtaining gun licenses from other states is not new. In 2007, the Ahmedabad Crime Branch exposed a major scam involving fake gun licenses from Jammu and Kashmir. Similar cases have since emerged from Nagaland and again from J&K two years ago. Despite these repeated exposures, no coordinated or permanent solution has been implemented to resolve the issue between states.",ahmedabad
Gujarat ATS busts arms racket using bogus licenses from North-Eastern states,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-ats-busts-arms-racket-using-bogus-licenses-from-north-eastern-states,2025-04-08,8,04,2025,"In a significant breakthrough against organised crime, the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), in collaboration with the Ahmedabad City Crime Branch and the Surat City Crime Branch, dismantled a sprawling arms trafficking racket that spanned multiple states. The syndicate was reportedly acquiring firearms using fabricated arms licences purportedly issued from Manipur and Nagaland. Acting on directives from senior state police officials to monitor organised crime—particularly narcotics and illegal arms trafficking—the ATS launched surveillance operations which led to a network of individuals procuring weapons through fraudulent documentation. The investigation, spearheaded by ATS Deputy Superintendent of Police S L Chowdhury, uncovered that individuals, including Vishal Pandya, Dhaveet Mehta, Arjun Algotar, Dhairya Zariwala, Ghelabhai Bharwad, and Mukesh Bambana, had paid substantial sums to acquire weapons through a gun shop in Nuh, Haryana. The shop was reportedly run by Sokatali Chotukhan and Farooq Ali Chotukhan, alongside an associate named Asif. The suspects were found to have used fake arms licenses issued in their names from Manipur and Nagaland. Police Inspector N R Brahmbhatt and his team were tasked with verifying the intel. Their investigations, which extended to various Indian states, revealed that over the past six years, several individuals from Gujarat had obtained firearms using counterfeit arms licenses from the northeastern states. Following coordinated efforts involving district Special Operations Groups (SOGs) from Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Botad, and Morbi, the authorities questioned and recorded statements from suspects across Gujarat. It was discovered that at least 49 individuals had procured arms through this fraudulent route. Those named include Selabhai Velabhai, Vishal Mukeshbhai Pandya, Arjun Lakhubhai Algotar, Dhairya Hemantbhai Zariwala, Sadam Hussain, Brijesh alias Bidu Mehta, and Mukesh Ranchodbhai Bambana. Further, three arms dealers—Sokatali, Farooq Ali, and Asif—were found to be at the core of this operation, selling weapons, including revolvers, pistols, 12-bore shotguns, and live ammunition to individuals across Gujarat. These weapons were kept by the purchasers under the pretext of being legally acquired. Multiple ATS teams were dispatched to Nagaland, Manipur, and Haryana as part of the crackdown. The operation resulted in the seizure of six firearms—comprising three 12-bore shotguns, two pistols, and one revolver—alongside 135 rounds of ammunition. Legal proceedings under the Arms Act have been initiated in Gujarat, and seven individuals have been arrested so far. Authorities have identified 49 gang members directly involved, and investigations have traced links to over 100 more individuals (referred to as ISMs) who are believed to have acquired firearms through similar fraudulent methods. A significant number of additional weapons are expected to be recovered as the probe progresses. Officials noted that the gang employed multiple tactics, including forging entire licenses, altering legitimate documents, and manipulating historical firearm records. The Gujarat ATS has launched an intensive investigation to dismantle the entire network and hold all involved parties accountable.",ahmedabad

Out of this amount, nearly 99% of the total donations went to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). BJP received ₹401.982 crore in donations in one year, whereas the Congress received ₹2.455 crore. According to a report released by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) titled Analysis of Donations Received by National Political Parties– FY 2023-24 , BJP received 1,373 donations from corporate groups and business houses, amounting to ₹367.2114 crore. So, more than 90% of BJP’s total donations in the year came from corporate entities. In contrast, Congress received ₹2.027 crore from just six corporate groups. On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) received donations from three corporate entities. BJP also received ₹36.798 crore in donations from 736 individuals. Congress received around 30 individual donations. Builders and contractors were among the top donors to political parties. Notably, all political parties are required to submit details of donations received during the financial year to the Election Commission by September 30. In 2016–17, BJP had received ₹174 crore in donations. In a span of nine years, donations to the BJP have more than doubled. While individuals cannot deposit money in bank accounts or secure loans without a PAN card, political parties seem to be an exception. In 2023–24, BJP received ₹1.33 crore in donations from Gujarat without PAN card details. Among these, a little-known company named Narayan Realty and Sairuchi donated ₹50 lakh. Surat, Vadodara, Bharuch-Ankleshwar donated heart out to BJP The BJP has received donations from companies and individuals based in Surat, many of whom are contractors associated with the Surat Municipal Corporation. These include contractors involved in the construction of flyovers and river bridges, as well as those handling roads, lighting, human resources, garbage collection, and consulting services. The donation amounts from these entities range between ₹1 lakh and ₹7 crore. The release of this donor list has stirred discussions in the local political circles of Surat. Majority of donors linked to municipal corporations In total, BJP has received around ₹60 crore in donations from Vadodara, Bharuch, Ankleshwar, and Narmada districts. Approximately 300 individuals or entities are listed as donors. Most of these are construction companies, though some are major corporations whose individual donations reach up to ₹10 crore. Many of these construction companies are tied to Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), engaging in infrastructure projects like roads, drainage, water supply, and stormwater management. It is alleged that in return for donations, these companies are awarded government tenders. Apart from companies, builders involved in the development of housing societies, flats, and commercial complexes have also contributed. Individual donors have not held back either, with contributions ranging from ₹21,000 to ₹51,000. In addition, a private university has also made a donation, along with several large companies from Por, Padra, and Savli areas of Vadodara district. In the public disclosures of donations received by political parties in the fiscal year 2023–24, the BJP received ₹2,243.95 crore across the country. Out of this, donations worth ₹401.98 crore came from Gujarat alone, contributed by 1,373 corporate-business entities and 736 individuals — which amounts to 17.91% of the total national donations. RMC donation contracts? A significant portion of the donations has come from contractors in Rajkot who have secured high-value contracts from the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC). In several instances, decisions taken by the municipal authorities raise suspicion of possible irregularities. Pawan Construction gave the highest donation — a total of ₹65 lakh across 8 separate transactions in just one year. In Rajkot, besides previous projects, the company recently secured road work tenders worth ₹74.40 crore in the West Zone, approved at 6.30% higher than base value (about ₹2 crore extra). Despite the elected body’s term expiring in 9 months, the contract included work for the next financial year instead of only the current one. Similarly, Classic Network Pvt Ltd was called under the pretence of negotiations but was awarded a ₹104.33 crore road work contract at 12% higher rates — again for two financial years combined. This company donated ₹5.11 lakh to the BJP during this year. Notably, both the companies had separate tenders approved simultaneously. Regardless of the election outcomes in February 2026, these companies will continue the work. For the iconic bridge project on Kalawad Road, recently inaugurated by Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, a ₹167 crore contract was awarded jointly to Backbone Construction Pvt Ltd and Gawar Construction Ltd. The suspicion of corruption arises from the earlier door-to-door garbage collection contract, which was overpriced four times compared to the existing ₹1,100 crore expenses. Back then, a ‘single agency’ condition was enforced to benefit one firm — but for this bridge, that condition was lifted to allow joint contracting. Backbone donated ₹14,24,652 to the BJP this year. High Bond Infra Pvt Ltd donated lakhs to the BJP. In September 2024, the Standing Committee of the RMC approved a pipeline project worth ₹10.82 crore at an inflated 51.81% rate — despite previously rejecting bids at 40% and 46% higher rates, eventually accepting this one with an inflated rate. KSD Construction donated ₹18.94 lakh to the BJP and received contracts worth ₹8.85 crore over the last two months. Armaan Infrastructure was awarded a contract worth ₹3.56 crore at 55% higher rates, after donating ₹1.27 lakh to the BJP. MJ Solanki and DG Nakrani, contractors supplying outsourced manpower to the RMC, each donated ₹1 lakh to the BJP. These are just a few examples. A deeper investigation could reveal many more such cases where companies donating to the BJP were awarded contracts at inflated prices. Major donors for BJP in Rajkot (above ₹1 lakh) According to available records, the main donors (mostly contractors) from Rajkot who donated more than ₹1 lakh to BJP in FY 2023–24 include: Pawan Construction – ₹65,00,000 KSD Construction – ₹18,00,000 Backbone Construction – ₹14,24,652 High Bond Infra Pvt Ltd – ₹5,93,642 Classic Network Pvt Ltd – ₹5,11,000 MJ Solanki – ₹1,00,000 DG Nakrani – ₹1,00,000 Doshi Electric Engg Co – ₹3,36,580 Vinay Infratech Pvt Ltd – ₹15,50,000 Marutinandan Construction – ₹6,00,000 Balaji Construction – ₹1,90,000 Pioneer Infrastructure Co. – ₹3,43,000 Ram Construction – ₹1,75,000 RK Construction – ₹3,69,000 Creative Construction Co – ₹2,44,000 Shreeji Devcon India Pvt Ltd – ₹5,00,000 Harshad Construction – ₹24,67,001 Mukesh Manekchand Sheth – ₹2,00,000 Narendra M Patel – ₹5,02,000 Armaan Infrastructure – ₹1,27,512 Siddhanath Construction – ₹2,50,000 Brick Stone – ₹1,16,500 Shree Satguru Developers – ₹2,12,000 Jitendra Equipment – ₹1,12,850",ahmedabad

The negligence and lack of action over one such complaint led to a horrific incident in Ahmedabad’s Gyanda society where a pregnant woman and her 4-year-old son died in a massive fire. According to housing society regulations, residential premises cannot be rented out for any non-residential or commercial purpose. Doing so is a direct violation of the Society Act. However, in Ahmedabad, over 3,500 societies openly advertise and operate commercial businesses from well-known residential societies, while the authorities have remained completely inactive. Societies are not even granted the legal power to approve such activities, allowing tenants or homeowners to exploit loopholes by paying taxes under shop establishment licenses and starting businesses at will, thereby damaging the social and regulatory structure of the society. An official at Amdavad Municipal Corporation said, “Complaints against such commercial activities can be submitted on the corporation’s website.” Credible sources have revealed that in areas such as Navrangpura, Naranpura, and Paldi, more than 300 residential societies have turned bungalows into hospitals, warehouses, and businesses with licensed medical equipment operations. Residents of Samast Brahmakshatriya Society in Paldi shared, “Our society has turned into a full-fledged hub of commercial activity. Similar commercial invasions are rampant across the Paldi area. Older societies are losing their residential essence. We have informed the corporation several times about transport and other business operations being run from homes, yet there remains a severe lack of sensitivity toward the issue of commercial misuse of residential spaces.” The fire at house number 24 in Gyanda society broke out after blasts of gas cylinders used in air conditioners were stored in the house. The society’s chairman had repeatedly informed the municipal corporation to put an end to the commercial activity taking place in the society. However, no action was taken, ultimately resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives from the same family.

All top Congress leaders are expected to visit Gandhi Ashram at 5 pm on Tuesday and participate in a devotional singing session (kirtan) . Will Priyanka Gandhi be given a major role? The CWC session will discuss decentralisation of power, alliances, and public outreach programmes. The convention has been given the tagline: ‘Nyaypath: Sankalp, Samarpan, Sangharsh’ (Path of Justice: Resolve, Dedication, Struggle). As per reports, Priyanka may be assigned a more prominent and active role within the party. With assembly elections approaching in six states, she is expected to take on a key responsibility. Currently, she holds the post of general secretary in the Congress, but she has not been given charge of any specific state or department. In the past, she played an important role in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. A cultural programme is also scheduled for Tuesday night, featuring performances of garba and tribal dances by artistes, including Mallika Sarabhai. Traditional Gujarati cuisine will be served to all guests.

According to reports, monkeys attacked a total of 20 pedestrians in the past 72 hours. A Jain monk walking along the road was also attacked by one of the monkeys in the Paldi area. On Sunday morning, a monkey attacked a woman named Parul Shah, who resides in Yogeshwar Nagar Society. She received 25 stitches while undergoing treatment at a private hospital. According to locals, a violent monkey suddenly rushes in and attacks individuals who are alone between the early morning and 10 am. It starts biting the legs and arms with its sharp teeth. Even if pedestrians shout, and try to fight back, it remains fearless and keeps on biting. In the Summer season, people who are accustomed to sleeping on the terrace or roof at night are also afraid of monkeys. Women are forced to keep the doors and windows of their houses closed and stay indoors. Earlier, people in the Vastral Ring Road area of Ahmedabad were forced to stay indoors due to the terror of monkeys. A similar situation has now arisen in the Paldi area. Despite contacting the forest department the violent monkey wasn’t caught by the authorities.",ahmedabad
Indian on Delhi-Bangkok Air India flight urinates on Japanese flyer mid-air,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/indian-on-delhi-bangkok-air-india-flight-urinates-on-japanese-flyer-mid-air,2025-04-09,9,04,2025,"The Delhi to Bangkok Air India flight AI2336 turned into a nightmare when an Indian passenger allegedly urinated on a fellow traveller from Japan. The ‘unruly passenger behaviour’ was reported on its Delhi-Bangkok flight on Tuesday which was later informed to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), as per a statement of airlines to media. According to Air India, a passenger named Tushar Masand urinated on Hiroshi Yoshizane, the Managing Director of Bridgestone India. The airlines reportedly said that when Hiroshi alerted the crew senior cabin crew members Sunpreet Singh and Rishika Matre responded by providing towels and assisting Hiroshi in cleaning up. The crew also relocated Masand from the area. Hiroshi was then escorted to the lavatory to change clothes, and the captain was informed of the situation. Meanwhile, another passenger onboard the same flight expressed discomfort and requested that Masand be removed from the J-class cabin due to safety concerns. After using the lavatory, Masand apologised repeatedly to Hiroshi, who declined to file a formal complaint, stating he did not wish to waste time after landing. Notably, this is not the first bizarre mid-air incident, a business-class passenger on a New York-Delhi flight urinated on an elderly woman in November 2022. The airline faced severe backlash for its handling of the matter, with the DGCA later fining the airline and suspending the pilot for negligence.

"On Mahavir Jayanti, explore these age-old Jain heritage structures in Ahmedabad",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/on-mahavir-jayanti-explore-these-age-old-jain-heritage-structures-in-ahmedabad,2025-04-09,9,04,2025,"Thursday marks Mahavir Jayanti — the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, the 24th and last Tirthankara in Jainism. So, let us journey through some of the enchanting Jain structures nestled in the age-old pols and gallis of Ahmedabad. Ahmedabad, the city which saw her first nagar sheth as the Jain magnate Shanti Das Jawahari, is home to over a dozen Jain heritage architecture. Mahavir Swami Derasar Mahavir Swami Derasar located in Tankshal near Gandhi road is the oldest among the five derasars of Mahavir Swami in Ahmedabad. This derasar is famous for its unique construction, and a lesser known fact, to date this derasar has no electricity, as per reports. The present derasar was reconstructed in 1922 by Sheth Umabhai Rupchand. Ashtapad Jain Derasar This Jain temple is tucked away in the old city at Doshiwada ni Pol, a narrow lane where the goldsmith community resides. Built in 1856 AD by Sheth Mangalal Karamchand, the Hindu-Jain style of architecture has human figures dancing or playing musical instruments in its motifs, besides animals and floral patterns. Interestingly there is a rainwater harvesting system that was built during the construction and is being used for the water needs of the temple even today. Ajitnath Derasar Ajitnath Derasar, located in Zaveriwad, was established in Samvat in 1855 (AD 1799) by Nagarsheth Vakhatchand. Renowned for its intricately carved marble pillars, the derasar captivates visitors with its rare idol of Lord Ajitnath in the Kaussaggiya posture, sculpted in precise accordance with scriptural descriptions. Shree Muleva Parshwanath Swetamber Temple The Jain temple on Relief Road houses a 200 to 300-year-old idol of Muleva Parshvanath, originally installed by Seth Kutumb in a temple at Idalpur (now Haripura, Ahmedabad). Over time, the original temple likely fell into ruin, and the idol was moved to the Panjrapole temple of Adinath Bhagwan. A popular belief holds that no devotee can worship this idol continuously for six months. The temple, managed by the Sheth Hutheesingh Kesrisinh Trust, was recently renovated without relocating the idols. Hutheesing Jain Temple Built in 1848 AD by wealthy merchant Sheth Hutheesing, it is an elegant white marble structure dedicated to the 15th Jain Tirthankara, Shri Dharmanatha. Located outside Delhi Gate in Ahmedabad, it showcases exquisite craftsmanship by traditional artisans from the Salat community, notably Premchand Salat. The temple features a grand mandapa with a ridged dome supported by 12 ornate pillars, a sanctum crowned by three intricately carved spires, and 52 surrounding shrines. A striking 78-foot Mahavir Stambha near the entrance echoes the style of Rajasthan’s Chittor tower, blending Jain and Sultanate architectural motifs.",ahmedabad

The Snow Park (Nabh Darshan) also promises a whimsical journey through the nine planets in a wintry setting. Adults and teenagers can explore the VR Reality Zone, featuring 20 interactive games and bumper cars, or lose themselves in the Mirror Maze, which allows for group exploration. The Adventure Ride, designed for six children, adds to the park’s portfolio of thrilling experiences. The revamped facility is not only expected to enhance Ahmedabad’s tourism appeal but also boost revenue generation for the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Officials estimate that the park, which previously earned around ₹10 lakh annually, will now yield approximately ₹40 lakh per annum, with 27% of the revenue to be shared with the civic body. Superstar Amusement Pvt. Ltd, the firm awarded the redevelopment contract, will manage park operations, including maintenance, staffing, and security.

"Kharge calls out BJP, RSS for spreading lies about Patel-Nehru discord at CWC meet",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/congress-cwc-meet-in-ahmedabad-kharge-calls-out-bjp-rss-for-spreading-lies-about-patel-nehru-discord,2025-04-09,9,04,2025,"After 64 years, the Indian National Congress held its national convention in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. On the first day, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge reignited the debate over the legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, accusing the BJP and RSS of promoting a false narrative of enmity between Patel and India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Kharge stated that in reality, Nehru and Patel were like two sides of the same coin, not adversaries as the BJP-RSS projects. Speaking at the national convention, Kharge launched serious allegations against the BJP and RSS, claiming there is a planned conspiracy to undermine national heroes. He emphasised that these organisations had no role in the freedom struggle and are now distorting history. According to Kharge, the BJP and RSS have falsely portrayed Nehru and Patel as rivals, when in fact they deeply respected and complemented each other. He asserted that both Nehru and Patel shared a close and respectful relationship. Despite differences, they worked together for the nation's unity. BJP and RSS, however, are spreading misleading stories that Patel was denied recognition by the Congress, while in truth, Patel’s ideology was fundamentally opposed to that of the RSS. In fact, Patel had even imposed a ban on the RSS. BJP using Patel’s legacy to discredit Congress: Kharge Kharge further stated that BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have organised various events to honour Sardar Patel, using these as tools to vilify the Congress. An image has been created that the Congress neglected Patel’s legacy, while BJP-RSS has nothing to show in terms of contributions to India’s freedom struggle. He accused the BJP-RSS of taking control of institutions associated with Mahatma Gandhi, even though they are ideologically opposed to Gandhi’s principles. He cited examples such as the takeover of Sarva Seva Sangh in Varanasi and recent events at Gujarat Vidyapith. “They may steal Gandhi’s spectacles and staff, but can never follow his ideals,” Kharge said. Sardar Patel opposed RSS ideology At the CWC meeting in Ahmedabad, Kharge emphasised that Patel played a key role along with Gandhi in appointing Dr BR Ambedkar to the Constituent Assembly. He reminded that Ambedkar had acknowledged that without Congress’s support, the Constitution would not have been possible. At the time, the RSS criticised Gandhi, Nehru, Ambedkar, and the Constitution itself — even burning their effigies at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He condemned a recent remark by the Home Minister Amit Shah mocking Ambedkar, suggesting people chanted his name more than God’s. Kharge reiterated that Congress respects both the Constitution and its creators, and knows how to protect their legacy. RSS cannot claim Gandhi-Patel’s ideals Kharge continued, “For years now, a conspiracy has been underway to malign national icons and Congress’s proud 140-year history of service and struggle. This is being done by those who have no achievements or contributions to India’s freedom struggle. They try to depict Patel and Nehru as enemies, but all records and statements prove otherwise.” He cited an example from October 14, 1949, where Patel publicly appreciated Nehru’s efforts and sacrifices. Kharge said it is ironic that the RSS — whose ideology Patel opposed and on whom he imposed a ban — now tries to claim his legacy. He concluded by saying, “Congress is the true custodian of Gandhi’s values. We carry Patel in our hearts and minds, and we are the ones continuing his legacy. The BJP-RSS may take over Gandhi’s institutions, but they can never walk his path. Gandhi’s ideals remain safe with the Congress.” “In the 140-year journey of Congress, Gujarat has been the state that gave us the most strength. Today, we return here to draw inspiration once again. Our true power lies in national unity, integrity, and the ideology of social justice. To carry this forward, we must first strengthen ourselves and our organisation,” he added. Kharge also said that more discussions and important ideas will emerge on the second day of the convention.",ahmedabad

The high court ruled that both wives of a retired and deceased government employee are entitled to receive equal share of the pension, and ordered the relevant authorities to pay the petitioner her share within three months. The court observed that under the Gujarat Civil Services Pension Rules, a wife is included in the definition of ‘family’, which also encompasses legally separated wives and husbands. HC ruled that as per the Gujarat Civil Services Pension Rules, 2002, it is clear that if there is more than one wife (widow), the family pension must be divided equally. The rules do not specify that only the first or the second wife is entitled to the pension. Instead, the rules explicitly state that the family pension should be paid equally between the wives.

A qualified civil engineer has filed a formal complaint alleging that his former colleague, Kapil Kumar Sharma—resident of Flat No. 1004, Block G, Shaswat Premisar-1, South Bopal, Ahmedabad—unlawfully used his personal and academic documents to float multiple companies and secure government contracts fraudulently. According to the First Information Report (FIR), the complainant Pankajprasun Singh, a native of Uttar Pradesh and currently engaged in modernising air force infrastructure with CHID Infra India, first met Sharma while both were working in Tajikistan between 2003 and 2008. Upon returning to India, Sharma reportedly proposed a business partnership in Gujarat’s growing construction sector. The complainant claims that Sharma requested critical documents—including a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) certificate from Bangalore University, PAN card, and passport copy—under the pretext of company registration. These were allegedly misused to fraudulently appoint the complainant as director of companies such as SKP Buildcon Pvt Ltd, Unibild Engineering & Construction Co Pvt Ltd, and Taniya Civil Projects Pv Ltd., without his knowledge or consent. The case takes a serious turn with allegations that these firms, under Sharma’s management, used the complainant’s forged credentials to bid for and obtain lucrative contracts, including those associated with the Ahmedabad Metro Rail Project. The complainant later discovered that forged mark sheets and experience certificates bearing his name were submitted to bolster Sharma’s professional profile in securing such contracts. Staff members from the joint venture’s office in Ahmedabad have confirmed that Sharma routinely collected payments and conducted business using the complainant’s falsified identity. Evidence has also surfaced pointing to the unauthorised use of documentation in dealings related to Metro project tenders. The scale of the fraud—including the value of contracts awarded and property potentially acquired—is still under investigation. Authorities believe Sharma may be operating from multiple addresses in Ahmedabad and Anand and could have ties to Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh. The complainant has submitted a translated and verified statement in Hindi, calling for a thorough probe into Sharma’s alleged misuse of his identity and professional qualifications.

Jain event turns political at ‘Navkar Maha Mantra’ day in Ahmedabad,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/jain-event-turns-political-at-navkar-maha-mantra-day-in-ahmedabad,2025-04-10,10,04,2025,"A significant event for the Jains in Ahmedabad ahead of Mahavir Jayanti changed course as a spiritual Navkar Mantra chanting event was turned into a political drama after the event’s essence was lost amid political speeches. On April 9, a ‘Navkar Maha Mantra’ day was organised at the GMDC ground in Ahmedabad by the Jain International Trade Organization (JITO) with the intention of spreading the message of global welfare, which amassed a gathering of over 25,000 devotees at the venue. While it was meant to be a spiritually uplifting moment, the event has sparked considerable discussion within the Jain community, being labelled as a fiasco. Many believe that the original spiritual intent of the Navkar Mantra chanting was lost, as long political speeches caused attendees to leave midway out of boredom. Additionally, there was discontent over the prominence of political leaders’ images instead of those of Arihants and Jain monks, which upset many members of the Jain community. Jain devotees walked out due to long speeches Musicians on stage led the chanting, for only 12 Navkars before concluding the main ritual within just 15 minutes. Following that, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the gathering virtually for nearly 50 minutes, during which he said, “Since childhood, I have been blessed by Jain monks. The Navkar Mantra is a salutation to 108 virtues. It is a mantra of soul purification.” However, many attendees, tired of the long speech, left the event midway, as per reports. Purpose of Navkar chanting overshadowed Devotees who had arrived early in the morning at GMDC ground for the chanting were shocked. On one hand, the sacred Ayambil ritual was being observed, and on the other hand, the programme was infused with political overtones. Although the attendees expected a deeply meditative experience focused on the Navkar Mantra, the reality turned out to be quite the opposite. The entire event appeared to revolve around political leaders rather than spiritual practice, leading to frustration among the devotees. Some attendees shared their disappointment, noting that the beautiful spiritual gathering had been turned into a political platform due to the presence of political figures. The frustration increased when large posters displayed images of politicians instead of Arihants and revered monks. Religious leaders from all sects of Jainism – Shwetambar, Digambar, Terapanthi, and Sthanakvasi – were also present for this significant event. The entire event was broadcast live to over 6,000 Jain temples and religious centers across Gujarat. Prime Minister Modi’s speech was also virtually connected through live video conferencing at all these venues. The Navkar Mantra is a significant spiritual chant in Jainism. Regular recitation of the mantra is believed to calm the mind, reduce anxiety, stress, and sadness, and bring mental peace. It is said to destroy sins, increase spiritual merit (punya), and ultimately lead to liberation (moksha). Additionally, the mantra promotes self-realisation, helps fulfill desires, and inspires individuals to follow the path of righteousness.

Remanded accused: The seven individuals handed over to ATS for 10-day remand are: Vishal Pandya Dhvanit Mehta Arjun Algotar Dhairya Jariwala Shailesh Bharwad Mukesh Bhambha ATS had initially requested 14 days of custody. Government Prosecutor MP Bharwad argued in court that a 12-bore gun, a pistol, 154 cartridges, and a gun license from Nagaland had been seized from Pandya, the main accused. Among the seven accused, three — Pandya, Algotar, and Jariwala — have allegedly used pistols and revolvers obtained through fraudulent licenses.

From Alagotar, ATS seized a 12-bore gun, a .32 caliber revolver, a license, and 26 cartridges. He had records for the revolver but none for the 12-bore gun, and reportedly used 80 cartridges—again with no clarity on where. Jariwala was found with a gun, a pistol, and 40 cartridges.

This raises suspicions of direct or indirect involvement of local government officials or employees in issuing the licenses—another angle ATS intends to pursue. Hence, the scope of the investigation is expected to expand to multiple states. Based on leads from the ATS, Surat Crime Branch has arrested four people—including the owner of Gajanana Gun House in Katargam, Surat and three buyers—who used fake Nagaland licenses to purchase weapons. They seized 20 firearms, 93 cartridges, and four bogus licenses. Another 16 individuals have been declared wanted. None of the six people who obtained licenses using Nagaland addresses have ever visited the state. Currently, separate investigation teams from Surat Crime Branch are stationed in Nagaland to dig deeper. Investigations have revealed that this racket has been ongoing for 6-7 years. Fake licenses were made to appear legitimate by creating false records of presence in Nagaland and registering them with the Home Department to obtain unique license numbers—making it easier to use these licenses in other states.

Couple robbed of jewellery worth ₹13 lakh near Chimanbhai Patel Bridge in Ahmedabad,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/couple-robbed-of-jewellery-worth-13-lakh-near-chimanbhai-patel-bridge-in-ahmedabad,2025-04-10,10,04,2025,"In a brazen early morning robbery, a couple returning from Mumbai was looted of gold jewellery and valuables worth ₹13.56 lakh near Chimanbhai Patel Bridge, close to the RTO Circle in Ahmedabad. The incident took place around 5 am on Wednesday when two unidentified men on a scooter intercepted their auto-rickshaw and snatched the woman’s handbag before fleeing the scene. Rameshbhai Jain, a businessman residing in Aradhana Society, near Jawahar Chowk in Sabarmati, had travelled to Mumbai with his wife Pushpa to collect custom-made gold ornaments ahead of a family wedding scheduled in June. The couple had purchased the jewellery at Zaveri Bazaar, having first visited Surat and then travelled to Mumbai with gold biscuits to be exchanged for finished ornaments, including necklaces, bangles, rings, and a wristwatch. On their return, they boarded an early morning train from Mumbai and arrived on Wednesday at Kalupur Railway Station in Ahmedabad. From there, they hired an auto-rickshaw to return to their residence. Pushpa carried a handbag containing gold jewellery, cash, and other valuables. As the rickshaw passed near Chimanbhai Patel Bridge around 5 am, two young men on an Activa scooter approached and forced the auto to a halt. One of them swiftly snatched the handbag from Pushpaben’s hands and sped away towards the Sabarmati area. Shocked by the incident, the couple immediately proceeded to the Ranip police station and filed a complaint. Preliminary investigations suggest that the assailants had been following the rickshaw from Kalupur Railway Station. Ranip police officials confirmed that multiple teams, including personnel from the DCP Zone-2 squad, have been formed to investigate the case. “We are analysing CCTV footage from the area and have notified nearby police stations. The rickshaw driver will also be questioned as part of the investigation,” said a senior police official. The police suspect that the modus operandi resembles that of a known gang specialising in targeted follow-and-snatch robberies. Further investigation is underway.",ahmedabad

The complainant, identified as Priya Kori, a resident of Chandlodiya, filed the case at the Sola High Court Police Station. She reported that her husband, Harsh Narendrabhai Kori, has been in custody at Sabarmati Central Jail for the past eighteen months, following charges under the POCSO Act. According to the FIR, Priya received a call on April 6 at approximately 10 am from a man identifying himself as ‘Karthik Pandya’, claiming to be the public advocate representing the opposing side in her husband’s case at the Gujarat High Court. He reportedly offered to abstain from contesting her husband’s bail application in exchange for money, thereby easing the path to bail. Initially hesitant, Priya later met the man that evening near Funblast at SG Highway, along with her mother-in-law. The individual reportedly showed her a photo of her husband and a list of upcoming High Court bail hearings, adding credibility to his claim. He then demanded ₹75,000 but eventually convinced her to make smaller payments totalling ₹20,000 via UPI to a QR code registered under the name “Jyotii Enterprise”. Further suspicions arose when the accused delayed the alleged hearing date and sent inconsistent messages. Sensing foul play, Priya contacted her husband’s legal counsel, Harshadbhai Parmar, who confirmed there was no such bail hearing on record. On April 9, Priya, accompanied by her advocate and mother-in-law, confronted the man outside Gate No 5 of the Gujarat High Court. When pressed for identification, he revealed his real name as Mayankbhai Mansukhbhai Sanghani of Jamnagar. Upon realising his deception, Priya immediately approached the police. The accused is said to have impersonated a government official and exploited the victim’s desperation, thereby breaching trust and unlawfully extracting money. A formal complaint has been filed, and the police are currently investigating the matter. Authorities have confirmed the registration of a case under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita relating to impersonation, cheating, and criminal breach of trust.

Speaking at the Fr Herbert A de Souza Memorial Lecture, Tharoor pushed for universities to be ‘open, inclusive and representative’. He stressed on non-violent freedom of expression and academic freedom. ‘Students cannot be stopped from protesting in universities’ “Today, academic freedom and freedom of expression in university education are under threat. Students in universities cannot be stopped from protesting, but the form of protest should be appropriate and non-violent. Moreover, as the privatisation of universities increases and the number of private universities grows, these institutions must reserve a certain number of seats based on scholarships, keeping poor and middle-class students in mind,” said Tharoor. The Congress MP also expressed concerns about the safety of university campuses. He pointed out several challenges including the influence of global trends in university education, growing bureaucratic interference and control in higher education, insufficient financial funding for research and innovation, deteriorating academic quality, increasing campus regulations, and rising threats to academic expression. Tharoor emphasised the need to focus on practical education in universities. He said, “Teachers should focus not on what students think, but on how they should think.” He noted that although private universities are rapidly increasing in the country, very few achieve global rankings or recognition. Therefore, it is vital that these institutions announce scholarships for deserving and financially needy students. Nehru’s vision and educational efforts Tharoor also reflected on India’s education system during the time of independence, highlighting the efforts made by the then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He said that during that period, India went through five decades of struggle. However, in 2025, Indian youth have far more opportunities, with new technological programs and courses now available in higher education. Tharoor criticised the country’s rising unemployment, attributing it in part to failures in the university and higher education system. He cited the example of Madhya Pradesh, where for 14,000 constable jobs (requiring only an 8th-grade qualification), 9 lakh candidates applied — including 10,000 engineers, 1.9 lakh graduates, and 15,000 postgraduates. He took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s past remarks on selling snacks as employment by referencing the ‘pakoda-selling’ comment. Responding to a question about university education, Tharoor stated that beyond classroom teaching, universities must train students to think critically, provide practical knowledge, and align education with the demands of today’s job market. On the issue of the Hindi language, he remarked that a national language must be one that is acceptable to all.",ahmedabad

Over half of liver ailments in ‘dry state’ Gujarat could be attributed to alcohol: Experts,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/health/over-half-of-liver-ailments-in-dry-state-gujarat-could-be-attributed-to-alcohol-experts,2025-04-13,13,04,2025,"Despite Gujarat being a dry state, alcohol consumption continues to be a major concern, with experts revealing that nearly half of all liver disease cases in the state are linked to excessive alcohol use. The alarming revelation came during a hepatology conference held in Ahmedabad, where over 150 liver specialists from across India and abroad gathered to discuss the growing threat of liver-related ailments. Doctors at the conference highlighted a concerning rise in cases of fatty liver disease, now increasingly affecting people as young as 40. According to Dr Pathik Parikh, “Obesity is a root cause of several diseases, including liver disorders. While liver disease was previously more common among individuals over the age of 50, we’re now seeing a significant shift, with people in their 40s increasingly being diagnosed.” Dr Parikh added that currently, around 50% of individuals are likely to have some degree of fatty liver. He also emphasised that alcohol abuse remains a key contributor, with nearly half of liver transplant patients being heavy drinkers. Experts also warned that summer drinks such as consuming sugarcane juice or ice from unhygienic sources can lead to hepatitis, which, if not treated properly, can further damage the liver. To prevent liver-related issues, doctors recommend regular health checkups, timely vaccination against hepatitis, and avoiding high-calorie foods and over-the-counter medications like antibiotics or so-called health tonics without proper medical guidance.",ahmedabad

Congress spokesperson Dr Manish Doshi alleged, “Drugs are being frequently seized in Gujarat, and the government, particularly the Home Department, is taking credit for it. But the real truth is that only the small fish are being caught, while the big sharks are escaping."" “The Gujarat Police has failed to nab the major players. The government has completely failed to break the drug network, which is why the drug trade is flourishing in Gujarat,” he added.

The attack took place at Ajit Mill Residency of the Rakhial area, where a group of individuals allegedly assaulted a resident using swords, iron pipes, sticks, and stones. The motive behind the attack remains unclear at this stage. Despite repeated efforts by the city’s police commissioner to curb such activities, this incident once again underscores the impunity with which criminal elements operate in the city. The safety claims made by senior police officials are now under scrutiny, with public confidence taking a hit. The Rakhial police station has registered a case under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and the Gujarat Police Act Section. Police have arrested seven individuals in this matter till now, and further investigation is ongoing. The complainant, 22-year-old Salman Khan Kamil Khan Pathan, a resident of Ajit Mill Residency in Rakhial, Ahmedabad, stated that the accused individuals, who live nearby in Sundaram Nagar, Bapunagar, have a history of personal enmity with him. As per senior police officials, during a community gathering in Rakhial, the accused took advantage of the occasion to settle old scores. Armed with swords and knives, they allegedly stormed Salman’s residence at Ajit Mill Residency and launched a targeted attack. Police suggest that the assault was premeditated, driven by personal vendetta. All the accused were apprehended promptly after the incident. They have been identified as Anjum Siddiqui, Asraf Adadatkhan Pathan, Ammar Anjum Siddiqui, Kalim Tofiq Siddiqui, Azim Tofiq Siddiqui, Javed Alam Niyas Khan Pathan and one juvenile, whose name has been withheld.

ATCS helps collect real-time data and algorithms to adjust traffic signal timings, and optimise traffic flow. This means if you get a green signal at one junction, you’ll get it at all the upcoming junctions. Using AI technology, all signals will be connected to a central server. Under the ATCS, different systems such as vehicle detection sensors, intelligent and connected ATCS controllers, communication networks, and central servers will be integrated with real-time data on traffic conditions at the junctions, corridors, and areas. This will enable real-time monitoring of traffic conditions. A detailed project report is being prepared based on necessary surveys for implementing ATCS-based signal functions, and KPMG Advisory Services Pvt Ltd has been appointed as the consultant for this project. Benefits of ATCS The efficiency of traffic signals will increase, and waiting time at signals will reduce. Signals will be synchronised, making transportation faster. Fuel consumption will decrease, and accidents will reduce. It will be easier to penalise traffic violators. Ambulances and emergency vehicles will benefit from a green corridor.

Despite this, the civic body and ruling party leaders are pushing ahead with the proposal, which is expected to receive approval during the upcoming meeting of the Recreation Committee. To assess the city’s green cover, a comprehensive tree census was initiated last year. The census, being carried out at a cost of ₹8 per tree, has so far counted only 1.40 lakh (1,40,000) trees. The data collection is expected to aid in planning future environmental initiatives more effectively. The last official tree census was conducted in 2011. Following that, the AMC had announced plans to increase Ahmedabad’s green cover from 12% to 15%.

The deceased, identified as Kaushik Chauhan, allegedly drove his MUV, an Ertiga bearing registration number GJ 27 TF 9895, at dangerously high speed, resulting in multiple collisions across the city. It is suspected that Chauhan was under the influence. He first collided with a vehicle near Vasna and then continued driving erratically towards Juhapura. He reportedly struck a couple more cars near the Al Aksa Mosque area, including a two-wheeler, before his vehicle crashed into a road divider near Azim Park lane. What followed was even more disturbing. Residents, angered by the chaos and damage caused, allegedly started damaging Chauhan’s car with stones and then dragged Chauhan out of his vehicle and assaulted him. It is suspected that he was beaten severely and left unconscious near the front of his vehicle. Vejalpur police, however, offered a cautious response. “There were no visible external injuries linked to the accident itself,” an official stated. “Preliminary findings suggest he may have died due to shock or injuries sustained in the assault.” The body has been sent to Sola Civil Hospital for a post-mortem examination.

"Gujarat additional health secretary held over ₹30 lakh bribery demand, sent to 3-day remand",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-additional-health-secretary-held-over-rs-30-lakh-bribery-demand-sent-to-3-day-remand,2025-04-18,18,04,2025,"In a sensational case involving a demand of ₹30 lakh bribe for providing a favourable report in a departmental inquiry against the then deputy director of Bhavnagar Health and medical services and his colleague doctor, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has finally arrested the absconding Additional Secretary of the Health Department, Dinesh Babubhai Parmar . He was presented before the Special ACB Court on Thursday, which granted a three-day remand. This is the first time a top official of an additional secretary rank has been caught in a bribery case, causing a significant stir within the state government. Earlier in this high-profile case, retired dean of the civil hospital’s dental department, Girish Jethalal Parmar—who had strong political connections—was caught red-handed while accepting ₹15 lakh as a bribe. He was remanded for three days by the ACB and was later sent to jail. Meanwhile, the prime accused, Parmar, had been absconding for several days. During the hearing, government lawyers Sudhir B Brahmbhatt and Assistant Government Lawyer C R Khatri argued for a seven-day remand, stating that both Dinesh and Girish had demanded ₹30 lakh in bribe from the complainant— Dr Manish Fancy, the then deputy director of health and medical services in Bhavnagar—and his associate doctor in return for a favourable report and assistance in the departmental probe. It was also revealed that Girish was caught red-handed accepting the first instalment of the bribe on behalf of Dinesh, showing clear collusion between the two. Key reasons listed for Dinesh’s remand –To investigate whether any portion of the bribe was meant for other senior officials or government employees. –To examine the extent of Dinesh’s assets and properties. –To scrutinise all his bank accounts and financial transactions. –To subject him to scientific tests at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Gandhinagar. –To record his video statement at the Gandhinagar Forensic Sciences University. –To verify the transcript and facts of conversations between the complainant and the accused. –To find out how many other individuals he may have taken bribes from and in what amounts. –To retrieve relevant files and documents related to the case from his possession. What was the bribery case? The complainant, Dr Fancy, had taken disciplinary action against certain health department staff for allegedly engaging in bogus medical practices. As a result, a complaint demanding a departmental inquiry against Dr Fancy himself was filed with the health commissioner. He and his colleague, Dr Sunil Patel, were then suspended and subjected to a departmental investigation. In this context, retired Dean Girish Jethalal Parmar contacted Dr Fancy and arranged a meeting with Dinesh Parmar, during which they demanded a massive bribe of ₹30 lakh to influence the outcome of the investigation in his favour. Nine days ago, the ACB had laid a trap in which Girish was caught red-handed at his residence accepting ₹15 lakh from the complainant.

Following sightings of stray cattle in areas like Jodhpur, the commissioner ordered a show-cause notice to the head of the CNCD (Cattle Nuisance Control Department), citing inefficiency in addressing the issue. During a recent review meeting, Commissioner Pani criticised the department stating, “Your work may seem good, but it is not appropriate.” He emphasised that no stray cattle should be seen on any city road and questioned the CNCD head’s authority to issue cattle licenses. “Who gave you the power to issue licenses?” he asked, further directing that all license-related files be sent directly to his office for approval. The issue was taken up seriously in the meeting after continuous public complaints and media coverage despite a Gujarat High Court directive to keep city streets free from stray cattle. The commissioner also reprimanded the Deputy Municipal Commissioner handling the department, holding them equally responsible for the ongoing problem. “I see stray cattle roaming in various city areas. This shows your department’s performance is lacking,” Pani asserted.

Kamlesh Kumar Motilal Shah, who runs a saree shop named Navaratna Silk Palace in Ramnagar, filed a complaint at the Cyber Cell after discovering that a total of ₹ 9.01 lakh had been fraudulently transferred from his bank accounts in multiple transactions. According to the FIR, the incident began on March 4, 2024 when Shah received a WhatsApp message from a number. The message, appearing to be from Canara Bank, warned that his Aadhaar-linked KYC was incomplete and that his account would be blocked unless he took immediate action. The message included a link directing him to download an app named CANARA.APK. Upon downloading and installing the app, a form prompted Shah to enter sensitive personal and banking details, including his mobile number, Aadhaar number, date of birth, and bank account credentials. Subsequently, he received another message from an unknown number, bearing a profile photo with the Canara Bank logo, requesting his customer ID. Believing the communication to be legitimate, Shah shared the requested information. Using the details provided, the accused allegedly accessed Shah’s bank accounts and initiated internet banking without his knowledge. On the same day, two transactions of ₹ 2 lakh and ₹ 2.13 lakh were made from his Canara Bank current account via IMPS. The following evening, on March 5, two more transactions, ₹2.50 lakh and ₹2.38 lakh, were transferred from Shah’s fixed deposit overdraft account, without his consent.

Ahmedabad Olympics 2036 bid: Government issues evacuation notices to 3 ashrams covering 140 acre,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-olympics-bid-government-issues-evacuation-notices-to-3-ashrams-covering-140-acre,2025-04-19,19,04,2025,"Gujarat is moving full steam ahead in its bid to host the 2036 Olympic Games, with major developments underway near Motera in Ahmedabad. Plans for a state-of-the-art Olympic stadium are taking shape as the government begins acquiring 140 acres of land, issuing notices to three ashrams including Asaram Ashram, Bharatiya Seva Samaj, and Sadashiv Pragya Mandal. Gujarat government is planning to develop the Sardar Patel Sports Enclave in Ahmedabad, which will house Olympic-level stadiums and infrastructure. Surrounding the sports complex, an Olympic Village and other related facilities will also be developed. According to the Olympic Master Plan, the state government intends to acquire 650 acres of land across the villages of Motera, Sughad, Bhat, and Koteshwar. Of this: 280 acres will be dedicated to the sports complex, which will include stadiums for various events and practice areas. 240 acres will be allocated to build an Olympic Village for players, coaches, and support staff. Another 50-acre infrastructure complex will be set up along the Sabarmati Riverfront, including facilities for arrival, departure, and related services. A three-member committee, consisting of the Amdavad Municipal Commissioner (AMC), AUDA (Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority) CEO, and District Collector, has been formed to determine compensation for the acquired land. However, in the case of Asaram Ashram, the government is unlikely to offer compensation, alleging that the ashram encroached on government land and constructed unauthorised structures. The Collector has also stated that the land allocated for charitable purposes has been misused for commercial activities, violating the terms of use. As a result, the committee believes no compensation should be given to Asaram Ashram. Also read: Gujarat HC stays State Olympic Association elections amid allegations of irregularities",ahmedabad

The arrest has led the Ahmedabad Rural Court to order disciplinary action against senior police officials for alleged negligence. The court expressed serious dissatisfaction with the handling of the case by law enforcement authorities, specifically pointing fingers at DYSP Neelam Goswami and Aslali PI N H Savseta, questioning how the main accused could remain absconding for such an extended period. In a sharp ruling, Additional Sessions Judge PM Sayani ordered the State Home Department to initiate disciplinary proceedings against DYSP N H Savseta and submit a comprehensive report within 90 days. The judge also dismissed the bail plea of Charan Singh, emphasising the gravity of the case and the prolonged inaction. During the court proceedings, the judge asked pointedly, “Who was in charge of this case file each year? Who should be held accountable for this delay?” The explanation given by the police was deemed “useless and merely procedural”, leading the court to criticise their investigation methods. Charan Singh was finally apprehended on March 26, 2025, at Maninagar Railway Station, following a tip-off received by the Ahmedabad Rural SOG. As a result, the court issued a stern rebuke and critical observations against DYSP Neelam Goswami and PI N H Savseta, holding them accountable for the serious lapses in the case.",ahmedabad

According to data from the 108 EMRI emergency services, a total of 34,124 cases related to breathing issues were registered between January and March in the current year. The majority of these cases were reported during the winter months of January and February, when pollution levels spike. In comparison, the same period last year recorded 30,903 such cases, indicating a 10.42% increase this year. Doctors have expressed concern over the rising number of respiratory patients, especially in urban areas with high traffic congestion. Along with heart-related cases, we are now seeing an increase in patients suffering from breathing difficulties. Medical professionals strongly advise people, especially two-wheeler riders who travel through heavily polluted areas, to wear masks while commuting. They also urge individuals to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any breathing-related discomfort. With pollution levels on the rise, the healthcare system is bracing for a continued increase in respiratory cases unless swift environmental and public health measures are taken.

"Over 500 patients at Ahmedabad’s VS Hospital underwent clinical trials, pharma companies refuse to share details",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/over-500-patients-at-ahmedabads-vs-hospital-underwent-clinical-trials,2025-04-20,20,04,2025,"Ahmedabad’s Sheth Vadilal Sarabhai Hospital has courted controversy. According to an interim report by an investigative committee, since 2021, around 58 national and international pharmaceutical companies have conducted clinical trials of their products on approximately 500 patients at the VS Hospital, which is run by the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC). These companies tested drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, skin diseases, and vaccines. According to Dr Supriya, a pharmacologist at NHL Medical College, these trials were conducted with patient consent. However, despite the large number of trials being carried out over four years without the existence of an ethical committee, most companies refused to provide documents for investigation. The committee has been gathering information from various sources connected to major pharma companies to pursue this investigation. Even though trials have been conducted at VS Hospital since 2021, officials of AMC and leaders of the ruling party were unaware of the situation. In fact, in 2021, Pritesh Mehta, current chairman of the TP Committee and then a board member of VS Hospital, had verbally raised concerns during a board meeting. The then-medical superintendent had reportedly responded by saying, “If you feel that way, I will resign.” Eventually, the matter was brushed aside and the superintendent was granted voluntary retirement. Two months ago, Chandkheda ward corporator Rajshree Kesari raised the issue during a general meeting of the AMC. Following this, the municipal commissioner took the matter seriously and formed a committee including the dean of NHL Medical College, the medical superintendent of VS Hospital, and the director of vigilance. After a detailed investigation, the committee submitted a report to the commissioner highlighting irregularities in clinical research and financial operations and recommended action. Patients were paid ₹200 to ₹500 per trial After submitting the interim report, committee members disclosed to the media that pharmaceutical companies were paying patients between ₹200 and ₹500 per trial. Bigger companies were reportedly offering even higher amounts. Typically, a pharmaceutical company first conducts trials on animals and then moves on to human patients suffering from a particular illness. Before starting trials on human subjects, approval must be obtained from the National Medical Council, the hospital’s ethical committee, and the patients themselves. In the VS Hospital case, it was revealed that companies obtained approvals from various ethical committees, many of which were unrecognised or invalid. For four years, under the protection of the former medical superintendent, companies conducted trials at the hospital without providing any financial support to the hospital, as per the report of the investigation committee. Fake receipt scam of 2013 In 2013-14, VS Hospital was involved in a fake receipt scam, where the amounts deposited by patients were underreported. Back then, only a preliminary police complaint was filed at Ellisbridge police station, which later led to a court case. Pratibha Jain, chairperson of the VS Hospital Management Board and Mayor of Ahmedabad stated that appropriate action will be taken once the full report is submitted, but refrained from commenting further. Critical questions regarding the clinical trials How did no one notice trials being conducted for four years? Did pharmaceutical companies make payments without signatures from HODs or the Superintendent? Why haven’t suspended individuals faced police complaints? When will there be action against those who caused financial losses worth crores to the municipal treasury? Why were only contract-based doctors suspended? Why aren’t records of the last ten years of the Ethical Committee being investigated? Why is there no audit of ethical committees in other municipal hospitals besides VS Hospital? Why is the data on how many patients received which drugs being withheld? Why is the amount paid to patients being concealed? Why are the names of the pharma companies whose drugs were used not being revealed?",ahmedabad

The deceased reportedly succumbed to severe head injuries after being deliberately run over twice by the accused, allegedly due to a petty dispute over a ₹30 fare. The incident occurred on the evening of April 20. CCTV footage from the area showed the victim walking along the road when a rickshaw struck him from behind, causing him to collapse on the spot. Shockingly, the driver then took a U-turn and ran over the victim a second time before fleeing the scene. The man died on the spot due to grievous injuries.

The complainant alleged that the group used abusive language, issued death threats, and physically assaulted him and his friend Rameshbhai Thakor in an attempt to extort money. The dispute reportedly stems from a series of financial transactions between Rathod and Bhargavbhai Rabari. As per Rathod's statement, he had borrowed large sums of money in 2023, including Rs 10 lakh in cash and an additional ₹25 lakh in securities, on which he was paying an exorbitant 30% monthly interest. Although Rathod claims he had fully repaid the amount along with interest, Rabari and his associates allegedly continued to harass him, demanding more money. In his complaint, Rathod recounted previous instances where Bhargavbhai and Bhaveshbhai allegedly showed up at his home and business premises, issuing threats and using vulgar language. Due to the repeated intimidation, Rathod said he had been forced to stay away from home for extended periods out of fear for his and his family's safety. The situation escalated on the night of the incident when, according to Rathod, the accused barged into the flat and assaulted him and Thakor.

From tropical Pina Colada to rich Biscoff Coffee and indulgent Ferrero Rocher and Gold Leaf creations, this summer’s gola game is not just refreshing, it’s reinventing tradition. At Jay Bhavani Golawala in Prahladnagar, tropical flavours take centre stage with their standout Pina Colada Gola – a frozen delight blending pineapple and coconut, inspired by the popular mocktail. Other fruity offerings like cranberry and blueberry also grace the menu, with prices ranging between ₹300 and ₹400. Vishal Somyani, originally from Rajkot, owns and operates the business along with his family, who have been in the gola business for years. They now have multiple branches in Ahmedabad, Surat, and Rajkot. “We wanted to bring something new to the traditional gola experience. Our factory ensures hygienic production, and every flavour we serve is crafted with quality and love. The Pina Colada gola has been a big hit this summer,” said Somyani. On SG Highway, Golewala has made a unique flavour for coffee lovers with its Biscoff Coffee Gola – a blend of sweet and bitter flavours that’s made fresh in front of the customer. Each serving is priced between ₹210 and ₹250. Darsh, one of the founders, started the business three years ago with his friends, bringing a new twist to the classic street-side treat. “Transparency is key for us. We prepare all gola flavours live, right in front of the customer. Our Biscoff Coffee Gola is for people who want something different from the usual fruit-based options,” he shared. Golewala also appeals to chocoholics with its Ferrero Rocher Gola, made with Nutella and topped with the luxurious chocolate itself. Over in Isanpur, Naiyya Gola offers a fusion of gola and ice cream, with flavours like Mango Dolly and Chocolate Gola -- the latter featuring an actual chocobar inside and costing around ₹400. For those with a sweet tooth rooted in Indian traditions, options like Rasgulla, Gulab Jamun, and Kaju Katli golas offer a nostalgic-yet-modern twist, priced at around ₹600. The shop is run by Haresh Modi, whose family has been in the gola business for over four decades. “Our family has been in the gola business for over 40 years. We’ve seen generations grow up with our golas. The fusion of traditional sweets into golas has been our way of keeping things unique while honouring Indian taste,” said Modi. “Our most popular item is the Kathiyawadi Gola, but many still prefer the simplicity of traditional stick ice golas over the dish versions.” And for those looking to splurge, head to Rameshwar RO Ice Gola near Judges Bungalow in Bodakdev, where the extravagant Gold Work Gola features 10 scoops of ice cream topped with edible gold leaf. Priced at ₹2,000, it’s a dessert meant to be shared among family and friends. Dilip Solanki, who has been running the place for over a decade, begins operations early in the season – just after Holi – to welcome the summer rush. “We start early every season to make sure people stay cool through the summer. The Gold Work Gola was created for families to enjoy together,” said Solanki. So, whether you're craving a tropical twist, rich chocolate indulgence, or a desi fusion surprise – Ahmedabad’s gola trail is worth the ride this summer.",ahmedabad

The accused, Zakir alias Rajubhai alias Sameer Karim Sait, had been evading arrest for over six years and was allegedly a central figure in a major racket that facilitated illegal immigration to the United States through forged documents and fake passports. The case, registered under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita alongside the Indian Passport Act, pertains to a criminal conspiracy in which several individuals colluded to create forged documents for clients aspiring to illegally enter the United States. The accused allegedly posed as agents, forged passports, and arranged visas for European countries as transit points, eventually sending people to the US via the Mexico border. Zakir Sait, a resident of Mumbai, is said to be a close associate of the main accused, Bharat alias Bobby Rambhai Patel. A Look Out Circular had been issued against Sait based on two Indian passports in his name, and Interpol had issued a Red Corner Notice. Based on inputs from technical surveillance and human intelligence sources, Sait was traced to Flat No 1201, Block-A, Jaibhari The Summit Residency, Nana Karamguda Service Road, Narsinghi, Hyderabad. He was apprehended and brought to the SMC office in Gandhinagar around 11.30 pm on April 20. During interrogation, Sait reportedly confessed to being an active partner in the network, primarily operating from Delhi. He is believed to have coordinated the creation of forged documents and facilitated travel routes from Ahmedabad to Delhi and onward to European countries. From there, clients were smuggled into the United States via the Mexico border. After the case was initially registered, Sait is said to have fled from Mumbai to Paris, returned briefly, then left again for Europe, eventually reaching Dubai and then Nepal before finally taking refuge in Hyderabad. Authorities recovered a mobile phone, ₹5,000 in cash, and an ID card during the arrest. Sait is also a wanted accused in a similar case registered at the Delhi IGI Airport Police Station. So far, 11 individuals have been arrested in connection with this case, including the prime accused, Bharat Patel. Three of the accused are currently in judicial custody, and a chargesheet has been filed. Investigations are ongoing to unearth further evidence and possible accomplices.",ahmedabad
"Ahmedabad's Foreign Post Office seizes sex toys, parcels containing suspected drugs",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-customs-seizes-illegal-toys-foreign-parcels-suspected-to-contain-drugs,2025-04-21,21,04,2025,"Around 200 parcels received at the Foreign Post Office (FPO) of the Customs Department in Ahmedabad’s Shahibaug area were found to contain sex toys, while nearly 30 parcels reportedly raised suspicion of containing drugs, including hybrid marijuana. According to reports, these parcels had arrived from countries like the United Kingdom (UK), United States (US), and Canada. However, no one has come forward to claim them yet. Authorities suspect that fake addresses may have been used to import the items under the radar. The Customs Department, in coordination with officials from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), police department, and Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), has begun a thorough investigation. Out of over 500 parcels received, more than half have already been processed, but several bogus packages are still under scrutiny. Officials also revealed that both male and female sex toys were found in large quantities. The suspected drug parcels are currently being tested, and authorities fear that some could contain narcotic substances like hash or hybrid ganja, which has become increasingly common in foreign post shipments in recent times. With over 500 parcels still pending disposal, concerns remain high that further contraband or banned items may be discovered. Previously, Customs officials had seized hybrid ganja during the disposal of unclaimed or suspicious parcels. Given the continued influx of such packages, officials believe more illegal items could be recovered in the coming days. The investigation is ongoing, and Customs, Police, and Crime Branch teams are jointly probing the matter.",ahmedabad
"Gujarat reports 23,800 heart-related emergencies in three months of 2025",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/health/gujarat-reports-23-800-heart-related-emergencies-in-three-months-of-2025,2025-04-21,21,04,2025,"Gujarat is facing a growing public health concern as heart-related emergencies continue to surge at an alarming rate. According to data released by the state’s emergency medical service 108, a total of 23,731 cases of heart-related issues were reported between January and March 2025 an average of over 267 cases per day. Compared to the 20,404 cases reported during the same period last year, this marks a 16.31% increase, raising red flags among health experts and policymakers alike. On average, 11 people in Gujarat experience cardiac symptoms every hour. If this trend continues, the total number of heart-related cases in the state could approach 1,00,000 by the end of the year. In 2023, Gujarat recorded 83,480 heart-related cases, while the cumulative number from 2023 to March 2025 has already crossed 1.78 lakh. Health experts attribute the increase of heart-related issues to irregular lifestyles, poor dietary habits, and tobacco consumption. Cardiologist Dr Milan Chag said that 30% of Indians in their 30s face increased heart attack risks due to unhealthy living. “One out of every five heart attack cases is now seen in individuals under 40,” he warned. Notably, the state health department is expected to launch awareness campaigns targeting younger people to promote preventive measures and early diagnosis of heart related problems.",ahmedabad
Five accused of fraud in leasing Waqf board property in Jamalpur,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gift-city-employees-can-now-bypass-approval-of-recommending-officer,2025-04-21,21,04,2025,"A case has been registered at Gaekwad Haveli Police Station in Ahmedabad against the trustees of Kanch ki Masjid and Shah Bada Qasim Trust. According to the complaint filed by Mohammad Rafiq Ansari, a resident of Jamalpur, his house belongs to the trust of Kanch ki Masjid and is under the control of the Waqf Board. The house was rented to his father 80 years ago for a monthly rent of 25 paise. In Jamalpur, along with the Kanch ki Masjid Trust, there is also the Shah Bada Qasim Trust. Both trusts are registered under the Gujarat State Waqf Board. The trustees of both these trusts collect rent from a total of 27 properties. As per the rules, 7% of the income must be deposited with the Waqf Board. Since 1980, Abdul Habib Sheikh, Amiruddin Abdul Habib, Mustafa Sheikh, Imankhan Rasul Khan, Sarwarkhan Pathan, Khalil Ahmed, and Abdul Karim Sheikh have been trustees of this trust. The trust properties include 100 houses and 25 shops. However, after the death of the original trustees, some individuals allegedly presented themselves as trustees and began mismanaging the trust. There is a piece of land next to Kanch ki Masjid which was handed over by the trust to the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC). The AMC had constructed Urdu School numbers 9 and 10 on this land. However, due to damage caused by an earthquake, the unofficial trustees allegedly exploited the situation by spreading misinformation that the building was unsafe and posed a threat to lives. Consequently, the school was relocated to another location. The building was then demolished, and the trustees allegedly constructed 10 shops on the land. One of the shops was allegedly taken over by a person named Salim Khan Pathan, who opened the office of Saudagar Constructions in it and leased out the remaining nine shops. The rent collected from these shops was neither deposited with the AMC nor the trust. Furthermore, individuals like Mohammad Yasar Sheikh, Mehmood Khan Pathan, Faiz Mohammad Chobdar, and Sahil Yakub Sheikh—who are not registered trustees with the Waqf Board—collected rent from around 25 to 30 shops and nearly 200 houses. Additionally, two illegal six-story apartment buildings were constructed and rented out for profit, as per the complaint. Salim Khan and four other influential individuals committed large-scale financial fraud by illegally occupying Waqf Board properties and exploiting them for personal gain.",ahmedabad
