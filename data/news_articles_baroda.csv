Vadodara police detained 8-10 Kshatriya youth on Apr 21, in connection with a foiled attempt to intercept CM’s convoy on its way back from a public event at the city’s Jhansi ki Rani maidan. Through the day, as many as 30 people were detained in a bid to ensure that the CM-led event went off without a hitch. Yet, a handful of protesters still managed to bypass the cops’ security arrangements, which included putting Kshatriya leaders in Vadodara under house arrest. Some Congress leaders were also reportedly under the police radar ahead of the event. Recently, “no-entry” posters, targeting the BJP, have sprouted in Vadodara’s Manjalpur and Laxmipura areas. The BJP’s campaign in Gujarat has been marked by protests against Rupala, ever since he made allegedly offensive comments on the Kshatriya community almost a month ago.

You’ll be the one facing the consequences in court, not them.

Municipal commissioner directly responsible for Harni Lake tragedy: Guj HC,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/municipal-commissioner-directly-responsible-for-harni-lake-tragedy-gujarat-high-court,2024-04-26,26,04,2024,"Gujarat High Court In a hearing of a suo moto public interest litigation (PIL) on this year’s tragic boat accident in Harni Lake, the Gujarat High Court has held the then Vadodara Municipal Commissioner directly responsible for the loss of the lives of 12 children and two teachers. The divisional bench, comprising Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Aniruddha P Mayee, directed the principal secretary of Gujarat’s urban development and urban housing departments to initiate a departmental inquiry against the then Municipal Commissioner of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and has asked for a report to be submitted to the court within two months. This is purported to be the first instance of the HC ordering a departmental inquiry against a civic body chief in a suo moto case. High Court’s statements on the Harni Lake tragedy The initial probe revealed that the lake’s contract was awarded on a lease for 33 years at a meagre price to Kotia Projects, a company without any prior experience. Moreover, the contractor was declared ineligible by the VMC itself due to a lack of financial stability in September 2015 but was awarded the contract two months later. The Municipal Commissioner had given in-principle approval to the first contract, but the Standing Committee had rejected its proposal. Within two months, tenders were submitted by two contractors for the second time, out of which Kotia Projects was awarded the contract. Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal raised some critical questions over this: “What happened in two months that a person who was earlier disqualified due to lack of financial capacity and had zero turnover was considered eligible and was awarded the contract directly? How did the contractor become eligible in two months? How did the financial stability of Kotia Projects increase in two months?” However, neither the VMC nor the authorities had a satisfactory answer to these questions raised by the High Court.

A demonstration was organised by the ‘All Gujarat Vali Mandal’ (an organisation of students’ parents) outside the school, along with the parents. They levied allegations against the school, stating that no other fee can be charged to students studying under RTE. Despite this, the school is pressuring them to pay ₹6,000 per year as activity and smart class fees. It is also withholding the results of students who fail to do so, the protestors alleged. “We cannot afford to pay such fees,” the group alleged. School principal, on the other hand, said, “A meeting was called with the parents and a proposal was placed before them for activity fees, over which they had agreed. Despite this, 10 to 15 parents later refused to pay the fee.” “They were only under the temperament to wage a fight. We have already given the first-term results to the students who have not paid these fees, and the annual exam results are also to be given today. A separate list for them was to be made. But the parents were enraged,” she said. Also read: Gujarat’s RTE allotment begins today: fewer seats, more hopefuls Right to education: How to apply for free education in Gujarat?",baroda
Doctor Who? Physios up in arms over Congress chief's complaint,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/doctor-who-physiotherapists-up-in-arms-over-congress-chiefs-complaint,2024-05-04,4,05,2024,"Physiotherapist Organisations Is a physiotherapist a doctor? Your answer would put on one side of a dramatic protest that unfolded in Vadodara today, when angry physiotherapists took to the streets to demand justice for their hurt feelings. At the root of the furore is the allegation that physiotherapist Hemang Joshi, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate for Lok Sabha 2024, is not really a doctor. The complaint, filed by Rutvij Joshi, Vadodara Congress president, states that the other Joshi violated the model code of conduct at a May 3 election rally. It says he used the title of “Doctor” falsely, in an attempt to manipulate and misguide voters, and gain public sympathy ahead of the vote on May 7. Hemang Joshi’s affidavit submitted to the election commission omits the prefix, which is nevertheless found across his campaign materials. The complaint, filed with the district collector, cites Indian Medical Association guidelines. The IMA website, citing a Supreme Court ruling from 1998, says: “physiotherapists are not allowed to portray themselves as registered medical practitioners by prefixing the word ‘Dr’ with their name.” Only those who have successfully completed an MBBS degree may use the term to denote their role as medical practitioners, it says. But local physiotherapist groups are having none of it. Bearing banners and placards at a protest near Chakli Circle in the city’s Alkapuri area today, they  demanded that the Congress chief apologize and withdraw his complaint against the young BJP contender. The BJP stand is based on a resolution by the Indian Council of Physiotherapy allowing its members to use the term. Joshi’s nomination, a last-minute addition to the BJP ticket, came after incumbent MP Ranjan Bhatt decided not to run this year over personal reasons. Hemang Joshi goes up against Jashpalsinh Padhiyar from the Congress, which seems desperate to regain its historical influence in a constituency that has seen BJP dominance since the late 1990s.

Rahish, a Subhanpura resident living in a rented house, received an SMS from Madhya Gujarat Vij Corporation Limited (MGVCL) stating that his bill balance was ₹9.24 lakh. Upon investigation, MGVCL discovered an error in their billing system, leading to an exorbitant bill. The customer’s actual balance was corrected to ₹1,037, which will be credited to his smart meter account. Another resident from Riddhi Siddhi Flats in the Subhanpura area faced a similar issue. His usual electricity bill was around ₹2,000, but he received an SMS indicating his bill had skyrocketed to over ₹9 lakh, with an option to pay ₹5,000 in installments. He has been renting out the flat for seven years, and was unaware of any smart meter installation at his residence, highlighting the lack of communication from the power company. The controversy surrounding Madhya Gujarat Vij Corporation Limited (MGVCL) ‘s installation of smart electricity meters in Vadodara continues to grow with consumers reporting a series of issues that have caused frustration. MGVCL has installed 25,000 smart meters across the city, and many users claim their prepaid amount of Rs 2,000 is consumed within a week of installation. “The smart meter app prompts consumers to recharge their accounts four times and disconnects power when the balance reaches minus ₹300. The new meters charge ₹4.29 per unit, a significant increase from the previous rate of ₹2.79 per unit. This has further aggravated consumer concerns, with some experiencing disconnections at inconvenient times, such as midnight, and speedy depletion of their recharge amounts,” sources said. The implementation of smart meters in Vadodara has been contentious since the election period, with reports indicating that meters were installed without adequately informing residents. While the power company views smart meters as a futuristic and beneficial step, many consumers see them as a daily headache. Complaints have been pouring in from various parts of the city, with frustrated residents frequently visiting the power company’s offices to express their grievances.

First  launched in 2008 by the corporation and the forest department, the project has faced numerous hurdles, resulting in a significant waste of public funds. To address the issue of aquatic life, particularly the crocodiles spread over Vadsar to Vishwamitri river, a decision was made to create a crocodile park at a single location. A survey was conducted to find a secure place for the crocodiles, and it was planned to build the park on 60 acres of open land near the Vishwamitri river behind the Navlakhi Ground. The project was conceived as a sanctuary for crocodiles inhabiting the Vishwamitri river, which flows through the heart of the city. As plans were underway to develop a riverfront along the lines of the Sabarmati river, concerns arose about the safety of both humans and crocodiles. Environmentalists opposed the use of heavy machinery in the river, citing the potential harm to aquatic life. Subsequently, the National Green Tribunal became involved in the matter. The project started slowly and, later, Vadodara Municipal Commissioner H S Patel, upon taking office, realised that the 60 acres of land in Rajmahal’s ULC was intended for housing. However, due to the land's riverbank location and difficulties with excavation, it was not feasible for housing. So, Patel decided to transfer the land to the Forest department for creation of the crocodile park with approval from the Central Zoo Authority. The Forest department allocated a substantial amount of Rs 5 crore for fencing, which was completed. Project flounders due to lack of coordination The project faced issues due to poor coordination between the corporation and the state's revenue department. The process of transferring land from one department to another should not involve a financial transaction, according to government norms. However, the Audit department raised concerns about the land’s value, leading to a halt in the project due to unresolved disputes about land valuation. Dispute over land transfer costs halts crocodile park The project came to a standstill due to disputes over land transfer costs. Although the Revenue department had given its approval, the Audit department’s objections regarding the land’s cost led to the project being stalled for years. Allocation of land for the crocodile park 60 acres of land were allocated for the crocodile park behind the artificial pond at Rajmahal’s Navlakhi Compound, with plans to create the country’s first crocodile conservation centre. Considering that crocodiles had made their homes in various safe places along the Vishwamitri river from Dena village to Vadsar, a decision was made to create a crocodile conservation centre for them in this region.

MGNREGA scam in Vadodara: Deceased woman’s account misused,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/mgnrega-in-vadodara-deceased-womans-account-misused,2024-08-19,19,08,2024,"MNREGA scam Vadodara A fraud has been uncovered in the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme in Samasabad village, Vadodara. A female labourer, Gangaben Ravjibhai Patanvadiya, had died, but her name continued to be used on MGNREGA job cards, resulting in the fraudulent withdrawal of funds from her bank account. Madhuriben Kanchanbhai Patel, the Vadodara Taluka Development Officer, filed a complaint at the Varnama police station against an unknown person. She stated that before joining her duties, MGNREGA scheme funds were directly deposited into workers bank accounts. Even though the worker, Gangaben Ravjibhai Patanwadi, had passed away, regular payments were deposited into her account. Normally, the amount deposited in a worker’s account was withdrawn from the ATM of a bank located on Vasna Bhayli Road. According to the Director of Rural Development Agency, Vadodara, an investigation was conducted. It was found that job cards were issued to the job card holders of Samasabad for employment from June to December 2022 in five phases. Job cards need to be cancelled after the death of the worker, but in this case, the deceased's name was kept active, and attendance was shown. An amount of ₹17,925 was deposited into her bank account as wages. After the discovery of the MGNREGA scheme fraud in Samasabad, the Taluka Panchayat issued a notice to the deceased woman’s heir, Laljibhai, to recover ₹17,925. However, Laljibhai did not accept the notice, so the Panchayat posted the notice on the wall. The case has highlighted serious flaws in the MGNREGA system and raised concerns about corruption at the local level.",baroda

The city received a whopping 12 inches of rainfall on August 26, coupled with a flood in the Vishwamitri River, leading to a double whammy. A death of a person who was crushed under a collapsed wall has also been reported in the city, while many have been rescued. After the Vishwamitri river level reached 34 feet, numerous areas in the city, including Sama Savli Road, Fatehganj, Karelibaug, Tulsiwadi, Hathikhana, Akota, Old Padra Road, and Vadsar, were inundated with river water. Thousands of societies and apartments in these areas have been submerged. Due to this double calamity, private hospitals and residential areas along the river banks have been flooded. Some hospitals have had to shift patients to other locations. In Siddhart Nagar on Sama-Savli Road, the combined effect of rain and flood waters has caused widespread devastation, with ground floors of almost all houses submerged. It is estimated that around 40% of Vadodara is currently submerged under the floodwaters of the Vishwamitri River, leaving lakhs of residents in a dire situation. Thousands of people have been evacuated from low-lying areas. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Gujarat Samachar (@gujaratsamacharofficial) Areas like Sumeru Duplex, behind Gangotri Party Plot in Sama Harni, and Silver Oak on Harni Motnath Road have witnessed water levels rising up to 5-7 feet due to the overflowing Vishwamitri River. The encroachments on the banks of the river have reduced its flow, causing the water level to rise rapidly and inundate the city. Even the Sayaji Hospital has been affected, with surrounding roads flooded by the river water. The hospital superintendent stated that as a precautionary measure, female patients from the ground floor have been shifted to the first floor. The heavy rain and flood have disrupted traffic in the city, leading to a shortage of nurses, drivers, and other staff. According to sources, the water level of the Ajwa Dam remained at 214 feet at noon today, and the water continues to be released into the Vishwamitri, indicating that the flood situation is unlikely to improve for at least a day. Furthermore, due to heavy rains and floods, around 50 feeders supplying electricity to around 2.5 lakh connections in the city have been affected, leaving thousands of societies without power since yesterday. Sources from the Madhya Gujarat Vij Corporation Ltd (MGVCL) stated that the power supply to around 50 feeders has been disrupted, and 11 feeders are still shut down.

Vadodara awaits electricity The floodwater of Vishwamitri River has raised concerns across the city as two power substations in Vadodara are submerged, 68 feeders are shut down, and more than 7 lakh people are without electricity. The situation of electricity supply in Vadodara has worsened after the floodwaters of the Vishwamitri River entered new areas. Due to safety concerns, the Madhya Gujarat Vij Company (MGVCL) has shut off power in additional areas. It is estimated that currently, 6-7 lakh people in Vadodara are without electricity. Sources from the electricity company mentioned that water from the Vishwamitri River has entered the Atladara and Vidyut Nagar substations of Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation (GETCO), leading to the shutdown of these substations. As a result, the power supply to 45 feeders from these substations has been cut off. This has plunged areas like Old Padra Road, Akota, Jetalpur Road, Gotri, Alkapuri, Atladara, and Vasna into darkness. Power supply to areas such as Karelibaug, Harni, Sama-Savli Road, and Fatehgunj was cut off yesterday due to the floodwaters, and it is unlikely that power will be restored today. MGVCL Managing Director Tejas Parmar stated that many people are messaging and requesting to restore power, but due to rising water levels, it is not possible to resume the power supply. He urged citizens to remain patient, assuring them that efforts would be made to restore electricity as soon as the water recedes. The electricity company staff is working to resolve individual complaints, prioritising the restoration of power supply to water-boosting stations.

However, there is some relief for the residents as the water level in the river has receded to 32.25 feet. This has resulted in the flooded water receding in many areas of the city like Vasna, Akota, Jetalpur, Manjalpur, and Diwalipura. Blackout woes “It is every year’s story now! No electricity, no water and other resources. However, water has receded from our house but streets are nowhere near to accessible,” says Sharmila, a resident of Manjalpur. “Though milk and water were provided by the authorities, we are still awaiting electricity,” she added. Students’ plight “The students living in hostels of Maharaja Sayajirao University (MSU) are facing difficulties due to the flood,” said Amar Vaghela, president National Students’ Union of India, Vadodara (NSUI). In a telephonic interview with Gujarat Samachar Digital , NSUI president went on to say that girls are stuck at the waterlogged hostel campus of MSU. “As the wardens of hostels are not responding to any calls, the parents of students are concerned,” said Vaghela. “The teams of the student union reached out to these students and provided basic resources like milk, sanitary pads, etc,” he added. The NSUI president noted that despite being aware that the flood-like situation would persist for several more days, MSU and other private universities chose not to declare an extended holiday. Instead, they only informed the students about the closure a day in advance. Since the floodwaters from the Vishwamitri River have not yet fully receded, many areas are still waterlogged, leading to the decision to keep educational institutions closed for another day. As per Vaghela, the university will be closed for a few more days. Crocodile sighting spree The Vishwamitri River, home to over 400 crocodiles, has seen its waters spread into residential areas, leading to frequent crocodile appearances in nearby universities, houses and even on roofs!

Proper attention was paid to ensure that photos of ministers were taken and videography was done. They held a press conference as usual. Finally, 1 lakh food packets were announced by them, however no details for the same were shared. No other assistance for the city has been announced, yet. Instead of focusing on how to get immediate assistance and relief to the people, the ministers shared their ‘knowledge’ on long-term flood prevention measures. Notably, over 6 lakh Barodians have been struggling with no electricity for over two days now. The people have criticised the government on social media for neglecting the city.

The Manjusar police have initiated procedures to conduct post-mortems.

Two individuals, the manager of the property and a security guard, died while attempting to drain the water. Preliminary reports suggest that both men died due to electrocution. Allegations have surfaced that the property owner forced them to remove the water from the basement. According to preliminary details, the floodwaters had filled the party plot’s basement, and locals had been requesting help from authorities for two days. However, after delays, when the water was finally drained on the morning of August 29, the bodies of Mayur Patel, 34, and Suresh Padhiar, 41, were recovered. Initial findings indicate that Mayur and Suresh entered the basement to remove water when they were electrocuted. Sunil Parmar, a relative of the security guard, alleged, “Suresh used to go to the party plot every night. Due to the rain, he did not go last night. The manager came to our home and told him, ‘Owner Ajay Patel is pressuring me to empty the water in the party plot basement. That’s why I’ve come to get you. I’m under a lot of pressure.’” Sunil further stated, “Suresh and Mayur were friends, so Suresh agreed to help. It is because of the owner’s pressure that Suresh and Mayur lost their lives.” He also warned, “We will not conduct the last rites until we get justice. If the bodies are released from Sayaji Hospital, we will take them back to the party plot.”",baroda

Vasava’s body was reportedly recovered from the river bank hours later after the forest department and local NGOs launched a search operation. A bystander reportedly stated that a similar incident occurred last month, where a crocodile engulfed an individual from the same spot. In light of the current flooding situation in the city, the social forestry department has deployed 18 rescue teams to handle wildlife emergencies. These teams include staff from the department as well as local NGOs and volunteers. The flooding has also caused crocodiles from the Vishwamitri River to be swept into various city areas. Along with crocodiles, snakes and turtles have also been spotted in residential areas. Over the past three days, more than 70 snakes and over 10 crocodiles have been rescued from Vadodara.

Situated near the Vishwamitri River, the zoo still remains flooded even when the waters have started to recede in other parts of the city.

Opposition stokes the fire The Opposition — especially MLA from Anklav constituency and chairperson of the Gujarat Congress Amit Chavda — has been quick to strike while the iron is hot. According to Chavda, the flooding, in which water from the Vishwamitri river wreaked havoc on the city, is not a natural disaster. Instead, he said, it was the result of “corruption, mismanagement, and illegal constructions overseen by those who have been in power at the Vadodara Corporation for the past 30 years”.

Vadodara’s 16-year-old river revitalisation  plan to be revived amid flood crisis,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/vadodaras-16-year-old-river-revitalisation-plan-to-be-revived-amid-flood-crisis,2024-08-31,31,08,2024,"In the wake of devastating floods that have ruined Vadodara, the Gujarat government has announced plans to revive a long-stalled project to revitalise the Vishwamitri River. The ₹1,200 crore project, first proposed in 2008, aims to expand the river’s capacity and remove illegal encroachments along its banks. The decision to resurrect the project comes amidst growing public anger and criticism of local authorities for their handling of the flood situation. Officially, eight deaths have been reported, with many middle-class and poor families becoming homeless. The government is facing intense pressure to address the crisis. The Vishwamitri River Revival and Redevelopment project, if implemented, would involve widening the riverbed, constructing new embankments, and removing illegal structures that have obstructed the river's natural flow. The government has directed local authorities to establish committees to provide immediate relief to affected residents and assess the damage caused by the floods. As the floodwaters recede, concerns about sanitation and public health are mounting. The state health department has been instructed to take preventive measures to prevent disease outbreaks. The minister in charge of Vadodara has assured that the river revival project will be expedited to mitigate future flood risks.

How a sarpanch of Vadodara village saved it from flooding,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/how-a-sarpanch-of-vadodara-village-saved-it-from-flooding,2024-09-01,1,09,2024,"Vadodara Floods Due to torrential rains in Vadodara and surrounding villages, many water bodies have overflowed and there have been cases of heavy devastation due to waterlogging in the villages. However, timely actions of the Sarpanch of Khatamba village in the outskirts of Vadodara has spared the village from flooding. A year ago, Sarpanch Kamlesh Valand, along with the panchayat members, built drains in the entire village at a cost of ₹5 lakh and installed mesh drain covers where the water was collected during rains. Therefore, this time around, the water drained within 15-20 minutes. Moreover, in order to prevent the lake near the village from overflowing and causing damage to the farms and residential areas, a 5 feet high and 10 feet wide embankment was made by spending ₹2,000 through the panchayat overnight. As a result, despite heavy rains, the water from channels of the farms was not diverted into the lake, preventing it from overflowing. Earlier, the Sarpanch had shocked everyone by bringing up an issue during the speech of the state president at the inauguration of the district BJP office, about the school in the village being neglected for a long time. “As the school in my village is dilapidated, students have to go to Bapod’s school, which is two kilometres away. Earlier the school had 150 students. But now there are only 38 students,” the Sarpanch had said.",baroda
No entry for politicians: Vadodara residents push back on post-flood photo ops,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/no-entry-for-politicians-vadodara-residents-push-back-on-post-flood-photo-ops,2024-09-02,2,09,2024,"Frustrated by the lack of basic services during the recent Vishwamitri River floods, residents of Vadodara are calling for a boycott of politicians and elections. While there are no polls due anytime soon, politicians have been flocking to the city for photo ops with its flood-hit residents. And the people are pushing back. In Purshottam Nagar Society, Akota, a banner at the entrance reads, “No leader or worker of any political party should enter this society.” Similarly, Pratap Baug Society residents have posted a notice requesting political leaders to stay away. They have also advocated for an election boycott. Flooding in the Vishwamitri is hardly new, but Vadodara last week saw its worst flood since the 1970s. Water levels rose as high as one-storey, even a kilometre away from the riverbanks. Areas that had never experienced waterlogging were flooded. People were left without electricity, water, and basic resources for three days. As the floodwaters receded, a host of politicians descended on the city’s affected areas–ostensibly to offer aid. However, the visits by leaders including Minister of State for Home Affairs Harsh Sanghavi, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, Balu Shukla, and MLA Manisha Vakil, and multiple corporators, have only fuelled public resentment. The growing public anger towards politicians in Vadodara highlights the deep frustration of residents who feel let down by the lack of preparedness and poor response to the devastating floods. With no elections on the horizon, the boycott calls reflect a sense of political disillusionment and a desire to hold the government accountable for its failure to provide basic services and disaster management. As the middle class and affluent segments of Vadodara society, traditionally supportive of the ruling BJP, join the chorus of dissent, the political fallout from this crisis could have far-reaching consequences for the saffron party.

Of them, one died on the spot. The remaining 14 suffered injuries and were immediately rushed to the hospital for treatment. The police have been informed and have initiated a preliminary investigation into this matter. Initial information suggests that while the youths were constructing a Ganesh mandap near the Verai Mata temple in Dabka, an iron angle came into contact with a high-tension line. As the youths were working at the site with these iron angles, a sudden electric shock channelled through the line, gravely injuring them. The preparations were underway near the temple ahead of the upcoming Ganesh Chaturthi festival, slated to begin on September 7. It is noteworthy that the festivities are coupled with the rainy season this year. In light of this, the authorities are on foot to prevent such unfortunate incidents.",baroda
Vadodara workers demand compensation after floods displace thousands,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/vadodara-workers-demand-compensation-after-floods-displace-thousands,2024-09-06,6,09,2024,"Vadodara floods In the wake of the recent floods and the devastation caused by them, Vadodara’s workers’ unions have jointly appealed to the Gujarat government for compensation for the damages suffered. The floods were caused by heavy rainfall and water release from the Ajwa reservoir into the Vishwamitri River. The appeal, submitted to the Chief Minister and Labour Minister of Gujarat, highlights the extensive damage workers faced due to waterlogging and calls for immediate financial relief. According to Narendra Rawat, President of the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) Vadodara, the floods submerged numerous homes in the city, and workers were particularly hard hit. In addition to losing household items, many labourers could not attend work for four to five days due to the flooding, resulting in wage losses. INTUC, which is one of the largest trade union organisations in India was established in 1947 to promote the welfare of workers and represent their interests in various sectors across the country. It is affiliated to the Indian National Congress (INC). The key demands by the workers’ unions include factory owners considering labourers absent due to the floods as “present” during those days, thereby ensuring they receive their full wages for that period. For workers whose homes were flooded, the unions are demanding a minimum compensation of ₹10,000 per household to cover the loss of essential items. The trade unions are urging the Gujarat government to implement long-term solutions to prevent such flooding, ensuring the safety and security of Vadodara’s residents. A call has been made for a judicial enquiry into the causes of the flooding, mainly focussing on any encroachments or corruption related to the building of embankments of Vishwamitri River and local water bodies. The unions have demanded strict punishment for those guilty of contributing to the disaster. The workers’ unions emphasised the “urgency of the situation,” noting that “many poor workers are now left in dire circumstances without compensation for their losses.” (This story was taken from a syndicated feed, and edited only for style by Gujarat Samachar Digital staff) Also read: Bodies surface as Vadodara floodwaters recede; death toll reaches 35 Vadodara flood survivors lash out at politicians on ‘flood visit’ Vadodara floodwaters recede, suffering prevails",baroda

VMC officer’s ‘live with floods’ remark sparks outrage in Vadodara,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/vmc-officers-live-with-floods-remark-sparks-outrage-in-vadodara,2024-09-11,11,09,2024,"VMC Dr Sheetal Mistry Chairman of the Standing Committee of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), Dr Sheetal Mistry, has sparked controversy with his recent advice to residents. He suggested they “learn to live with floods” and keep tubes and rafts at home for future preparedness. His comments have drawn sharp criticism, with many accusing him of being out of touch with the struggles faced by residents during the recent flood crisis. In the last week of August, Gujarat was hit by heavy rainfall, leading to severe flooding and the tragic loss of over 49 lives due to incidents such as lightning strikes, wall collapses, and drowning. The situation prompted large-scale rescue operations involving the NDRF, Army, and other agencies, evacuating more than 37,000 people. The city experienced a historic flood which severely disrupted public life for three to four days. The municipal system and elected representatives were criticised for failing to provide adequate relief to the public. Amidst this backdrop, Dr Mistry’s statement has been widely mocked and seen as insensitive. Dr Mistry urged citizens to prepare for heavy rain by keeping safety equipment like tubes, rafts, and ropes readily available. “We need to learn to live with heavy rains,” he said, shifting responsibility from the municipal authorities to the residents. His remarks have raised questions about the effectiveness of flood management in a city being developed as a “smart city”. After the floods, reducing pressure on the Vishwamitri riverbanks has become a significant topic of discussion. Experts suggest that addressing this could help prevent future flooding. However, instead of focusing on long-term solutions, the municipal leadership's advice has been widely criticised as impractical and disconnected from the people's needs. Meanwhile, a collage depicting the flood-ravaged streets of Vadodara has become the backdrop for a Ganesh pandal in Vadodara. The protest comes from about 100 families residing in Karelibaug, which saw severe waterlogging of up to 12 feet during the August floods. The images are accompanied by a warning message directed at the BJP’s elected representatives, barring them from entering the society’s premises.

An official said that the investigating agency acted on credible information that Bhoya engaged in corrupt practices during his tenure in Surat, acquiring assets in his and his family members’ names. He added that the investigation, covering his period from April 2012 to March 2020, revealed that Bhoya’s financial transactions were suspicious. Authorities collected records, including bank details and documents from various government offices, to analyse his expenditures. The investigation found that Bhoya illegally accumulated wealth and invested heavily in properties while misusing his position as a public servant. His legal income during this period amounted to ₹2.75 crore, but his total expenditures and investments reached ₹4.33 crore. Bhoya's assets were found to be 56.97% higher than his legitimate earnings, with a gap of ₹1.57 crore. Vadodara ACB Inspector A N Prajapati filed the case at the ACB police station, and the investigation is ongoing under the supervision of Assistant Director P H Bhensaniya.

Amid the helpless environment, the Chairperson of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s Standing Committee, Dr Shital Mistry advised people to buy life jackets, ropes, and boats to prepare for flooding and heavy rains. This statement from the chairperson has caused significant displeasure among the public, and while it was considered laughable, a resident of Vadodara followed her advice and bought a boat by mortgaging their household jewellery. Resident of Samrajya Township, located on the banks of the Vishwamitri River, purchased boat and other equipment by mortgaging their gold. Expressing his frustration, he said that regrettably, he had to buy the boat by following the chairperson’s advice. The Samrajya Township, situated in the Mujmahuda area on the banks of the Vishwamitri River, experienced severe flooding. During the flood, several feet of water had accumulated in the house of Chirag Brahmbhatt, causing him considerable difficulty. Derisively, during the flood, the chairperson Mistry advised people to buy boats, life jackets, ropes, and torches for self-defence. Following this advice, Brahmbhatt mortgaged his gold jewellery and took a loan to buy a boat for ₹40,000 to protect his elderly mother and wife during future floods.

In the past 15 days, the city’s municipal corporation has reported an increase in dengue cases, jumping from 215 cases on September 2 to 289 on September 15. The floodwaters and persistent rainfall have created ideal breeding conditions for dengue mosquitoes. These insects thrive in stagnant water, which is abundant in the city during the monsoon season. Areas with water storage containers, old tires, and flower pots are particularly prime areas to mosquito breeding. To combat the rising number of cases, the municipal corporation has launched intensive fogging and mosquito control operations. Additionally, they are inspecting construction sites to prevent further mosquito breeding. Along with dengue, there has been a surge in other waterborne diseases, including fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. A recent survey has identified 168 fever cases in the city. The Sir Sayajirao General (SSG) Hospital has witnessed an increase in patients seeking treatment in its outpatient department (OPD). In response to the growing number of dengue cases, the hospital has established a dedicated 28 bed ward for dengue patients. The hospital is prepared to expand the ward capacity if needed.

It is estimated that 25% to 30% of the submerged cars are likely to be irreparable, leading to massive losses for the owners. The aftermath of the floods has led to a massive backlog in car repairs. With the city’s workshops filled with damaged vehicles, many car owners are facing long waits. Some repair shops are now saying that vehicles will not be returned until after Diwali, due to the sheer volume of work. Currently, Vadodara has over 25 insurance companies processing claims related to flood damage. Despite government directives to expedite the settlement of these claims, the flood of claims and the capacity constraints of local workshops are causing delays. To address the repair demand, workshops had to bring in over 100 additional workers from outside the city, according to an official.

The solar panels, installed at strategic locations such as Sama, Nimeta, and Raval, are part of a larger 35 MW solar power project. A total of 1,16,366 panels have been set up, significantly boosting the state’s clean energy output. “This solar initiative reduces Gujarat’s reliance on traditional energy sources and contributes to a sustainable future by capitalising on the abundant sunlight available in the region. Since its inception in 2015, the solar project at Sama Canal has installed 33,816 panels along a 3.6 km stretch. These panels, supported by a 1,600-tonne modular structure, are placed 22 metres above the canal and connected to 14 inverters and two transformers. The 10 MW facility has become a popular point of interest for citizens entering Vadodara from Dumad. Over the past decade, this segment alone has produced 4.23 million units of electricity,” Power Department officials shared. The Nimeta plant, with a 4-kilometre-long solar array, is the largest among the installations, featuring 33,080 panels supported by 1,623 tonnes of steel. Sardar Sarovar Nigam also used nearby land to establish a 5 MW solar facility, utilising 15,874 adjustable solar panels that can rotate to capture optimal sunlight. These two plants, operational since 2017, have produced 15.97 million units of electricity. University students frequently visit these 15 MW facilities to study the innovative design. Similarly, a solar plant has been set up along the branch canal near Raval in Waghodia taluka. This 10 MW project includes 33,600 solar panels supported by a 443-tonne steel structure.

The generated electricity is fed into the local grid, helping Gujarat make significant progress in clean energy production. Experts note that Gujarat’s geographic advantage allows for efficient solar energy generation from 7.30 am to 5.45 pm with peak production between 11.30 am and 3.30 pm. The solar panels are regularly cleaned to maintain efficiency and prevent dust accumulation.

The police identified the accused as Muhammad Junaid Ahmed Malek, who was arrested at Ahmedabad’s SVPI airport upon his return from Dubai after a Look Out Circular (LOC) notice was issued against him. The scam began when the victim received a message offering money to complete tasks online. After registering using a link provided by the fraudsters, the victim was instructed to carry out various tasks related to online purchases, during which ₹1.69 lakh was transferred to multiple accounts. When the victim attempted to withdraw their earnings, the scammer stopped answering calls, leading the victim to realise they had been duped. A complaint was filed with the Cyber Crime Police which used technical and human sources to trace the fraud back to Malek, who had been residing in Dubai. Further investigation revealed that Malek had been involved in a broader network, sourcing bank accounts and SIM cards from Indian ‘friends’ in exchange for commissions. He also collaborated with a Chinese agent in Dubai, using the accounts for fraud. According to the NCCRP portal, Malek has 23 complaints filed against him across 11 states. An official said that the arrest is part of a larger crackdown on a Dubai-based fraud network, with 11 suspects arrested across four states. The Cyber Crime Police have issued multiple LOCs against the accused operating from abroad, and two other members of the same Dubai network were previously arrested. Further legal proceedings against Malek are underway. A report tabled in the Lok Sabha earlier this year revealed that people in Gujarat lost ₹156 crore due to financial cyber frauds in 2023.

Gandhi explained that each team had to create a model where products of specific sizes would automatically be checked and defective products would be removed, using information technology and operational technology. “""To achieve this, we first collected machine data and installed sensors and cameras to check the product sizes. We made necessary improvements to the manufacturing execution system (MES) software program,”"" added Gandhi.

"After flood fury, notices sent to encroachers along Vishwamitri River in Vadodara",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/after-flood-fury-notices-sent-to-encroachers-along-vishwamitri-river-vadodara,2024-09-25,25,09,2024,"Encroachments in Vishwamitri, Vadodara After several parts of Vadodara in Gujarat faced flood fury in August, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has issued notices to people and entities for encroachments along the Vishwamitri River. The flood fury had severely impacted the people and following the public outrage, the VMC has issued notices for 13 locations, including Agora Mall, for unauthorised constructions along the river. The corporation conducted thorough drone surveys, record inspections, and on-site visits, identifying various encroachments, such as kitchens, clubhouses, and retaining walls. The encroachers have been given three days to respond, after which the VMC will act to remove the illegal structures. Some have already begun voluntarily dismantling their encroachments. The VMC has issued notices to several sites, including Water Lily in Vadsar, where a labour camp and retaining wall were identified, and voluntary removal has already been initiated. Similarly, Maryland Party Plot and Global Discovery School, both with canteen encroachments, have also begun voluntary removal efforts. Other sites include a site office near the bridge opposite Somnath Villa in Harni, a building opposite Urmi School in Harni, and a 55-room structure at Kashiba Children Hospital in Karelibaug. The Shruti Mandir Ashram in Harni was found to have unauthorised construction, including a temple dome and prayer rooms. Agora Mall in Sama was identified for its clubhouse and retaining wall encroachments, while an industrial estate on Bahucharaji Road in Karelibaug and Vishwakunj Society both had temporary fabrication sheds. Lastly, the R C Patel Estate in Akota had a labour camp and retaining wall, and two buildings near Global School in Harni were also identified as encroachments. The floods, which caused widespread disruption, intensified public demands for the removal of illegal constructions along the riverbanks. Vadodara Municipal Commissioner Dilip Rana confirmed that action is being taken after identifying the violations and stressed that those failing to comply with the notices will face further enforcement. In August, Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel gave in-principle approval to a ₹1,200 crore project to revive and rejuvenate the Vishwamitri River. This follows a similar proposal by the BJP-led VMC)in 2010 for the Vishwamitri Riverfront Development Project, for which a special-purpose vehicle was created, but no progress was made. In 2019, after another round of flooding, the BJP government under then-Chief Minister Vijay Rupani announced a large-scale project to rejuvenate the Vishwamitri River. Although the National Green Tribunal had approved the detailed project report, it was never implemented.

Ancient artefacts of MSU’s archeology dept open to elements for over a month,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ancient-artefacts-of-msu-archeology-dept-open-to-elements-for-over-a-month,2024-09-29,29,09,2024,"The 3000-year-old artefacts of The Maharaja Sayajirao University’s Archaeology Department have been reportedly lying outside the faculty premises for a month. During the recent Vishwamitri flood, water entered the basement of the Archaeology Department, damaging historical artefacts. Currently, these artefacts have been removed and placed outside. There is confusion about how and where to preserve this ancient heritage in possession of the university. Since the establishment of the Archaeology Department, researchers and students have excavated hundreds of years-old artefacts from dozens of sites, including Vadnagar, Devni Mori, Shamlaji, Bagsara, Nagvada, Nageshwar, Prabhas Patan, and Sikarpur. Many of these genuine artefacts are linked to the 3000-year-old Harappan culture and the Buddhist period, including clay and stone utensils, clay and stone jewellery, tools, stone weapons, statues, etc. The basement of the Archaeology Department, which is 80 feet long and 40 feet wide, is used for storing these artefacts. The artefacts removed from the basement are currently in plastic crates and have had to be placed in the department’s lobby as well as outside. Numerous times in the last month, these artefacts have been soaked in rain. Sources indicate that the cleaning of the basement will continue for a few more days. After that, the basement will be whitewashed, treated for moisture, and the entrance sealed to prevent water from entering again. Researchers excavated 50 sites in past According to Prof Ajith Prasad, the former head of the Archaeology Department, since its establishment in 1953, researchers from the department have excavated at nearly 50 sites, including some in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. The artefacts discovered here are brought to the faculty and are mostly stored in the basement. The artefacts are used for teaching archaeology subjects to students. The water of the Bhukhi nullah – the tributary of Vishwamitri river that passes from the university campus took over the whole campus leading to flooding in the Archaeology Department’s basement. This was the first time that floodwaters have reached the Archaeology Department. In the past, floodwaters had never entered the basement. Amid complaints about inadequate security in the Arts Faculty, the Dean of the Arts Faculty has written a letter to the university registrar requesting the appointment of four additional security guards due to the artefacts being placed outside, to ensure that no unauthorised elements tamper with them.

However, the reptile was soon rescued by the Forest Department official with the help of local volunteers. Upon reaching the site, the rescue team initially struggled as the crocodile thrashed around, making several attempts to escape after being trapped in a noose. Despite resistance, the team successfully captured the crocodile after an hour and a half of effort. The rising water levels of the Vishwamitri River in Vadodara have led to an increase in crocodile sightings near residential zones. The rescue mission carried out with the assistance of local police and Forest Department officials, ended with the crocodile being safely caged and handed over to the Forest Department for relocation. Today, the Vishwamitri River's water level stood at 25 feet, while the Ajwa reservoir recorded 213.25 feet. Although the river’s water level remains a concern, officials said the situation will improve as no further rain has been reported. Despite the rain subsiding, the Ruparel canal was overflowing. The canal was cleaned using the much-touted drain master machine as part of pre-monsoon efforts but has failed to handle the water inflow. Meanwhile, the Gujarat Forest Department rescued 24 crocodiles from Vadodara’s residential areas during the flood in August 2024. Vadodara Range Forest officials said that the Vishwamitri River is home to approximately 440 crocodiles. Water released from the Ajwa Dam contributed to the flooding of nearby residential areas, causing these reptiles to stray into populated areas closer to the riverbed. “The smallest crocodile we rescued was two feet long, while the largest, measuring 14 feet, was in Kamnath Nagar, near the river. During the floods, we rescued two 11-foot crocodiles from EME Circle and an open area near the Zoology Department of MS University,” the official said.

Bhatt announced the induction of the staff at the Ayyappa Maidan garba on social media, framing it as part of the ""#Sadsyata_Abhiyan_2024"" (Membership Campaign 2024) on the first day of Shardiya Navratri. This mass induction is part of the BJP’s nationwide membership campaign launched on September 2, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call to expand the party's base among women, youth, and traditionally weak areas. The party’s recruitment strategy has been making waves with BJP leaders recruiting people from various public gatherings and events. They have also been seen asking for OTP on mobile phones to register new members, a shift from traditional face-to-face ideology-based recruitment. Bhatt has previously inducted all the staff of a Nizampura-based beauty salon into the party and has actively pursued artisans from the diamond industry to sign up. She also claims to have introduced several women near New Sama’s Bal Gopal Garba ground, in Valsad’s Chhiri village and at Swayambhu Bhavnath Mahadev Temple in Junagadh to the BJP ideology. The vigorous membership drive reflects the BJP's push to bolster its support base, but the effectiveness and long-term impact of these recruitment methods remain to be seen.",baroda

Contaminated water sparks outrage in Vadodara locality,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/contaminated-water-sparks-outrage-in-vadodara-locality,2024-10-06,6,10,2024,"Protests erupted in the Nagarwada area of Gujarat’s Vadodara over the supply of contaminated drinking water. Hundreds of residents gathered opposite the local ward office and staged a protest. The issue, which has been ongoing for some time, reached a tipping point when black, gutter-contaminated water began flowing through household taps. In response to the crisis, water tankers have been deployed to supply potable water, though residents argue this is only a temporary fix. The situation remained tense as over 50 families in the area struggled with their water supply. The residents warned that if “their demands are not met, they will escalate their protest.” Being developed as a ‘smart city,’ Vadodara still struggles to provide necessities like clean drinking water. Locals are demanding the immediate replacement of the decades-old water pipeline with a new system that can meet the current demands of the growing population. Snehal Mali, a resident of Mali Maholla, voiced his frustration, stating, “We have been receiving dirty, contaminated water for a long time, and now it’s mixed with gutter water. This is the third day we’ve had to rely on tankers, and we’re given just 15 minutes to fill up. Our corporator, Shweta Uttekar, is responsible for sending the tankers, but she won’t even take our calls. We also tried speaking with another corporator, Bandish Shah, but he isn’t willing to listen. Our water pipeline is outdated, and our water needs have also risen with the increasing number of families.” Another resident added, “We can’t get enough water for drinking or daily use. Our livelihoods are being affected. The corporator doesn’t visit; for three days, all they’ve done is dig trenches. We need a larger water pipe immediately.” In February 2024, City Congress President Rutvij Joshi, along with Corporator Chandrakant Shrivastav marched to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and submitted a memorandum to Commissioner Dilip Kumar Rana, calling for strict measures to address the issue. “It is disgraceful that Ward No. 6, represented by Standing Committee Chairman Dr. Sheetal Mistry, has been dealing with contaminated water for several months. There appears to be collusion between the VMC and private water tanker suppliers, as residents are forced to pay for clean water. At the same time, the civic body delivers contaminated supply,” the Congress statement read. “This matter must be resolved immediately. If the issue cannot be addressed, the standing committee chairman should resign for failing to serve his constituents.” (This story was taken from a syndicated feed and was only edited for style by Gujarat Samachar Digital staff) Also read : Four children die in a week Bhuj, contaminated water suspected",baroda

The minor victim, a Class 12 science stream student, met 19-year-old Wajidsha Diwan four months ago on Instagram. Diwan, a resident of the city’s Makarpura area, befriended the girl and forced her to engage in a love affair with him. He showed up at her school on numerous occasions and used to invite her to play garba and click pictures with him on the ground in Manjalpur during the ongoing Navratri festival. Tired of his persistent demands, the victim tried cutting off ties with Diwan. However, when the girl’s brother approached the accused to resolve the matter, Diwan threatened to abduct the girl once she turned 18. In one instance, Diwan took the victim to a friend’s place near the SRP Group campus in Navapura, where he raped her. After she mentioned it to her mother, they approached Manjalpur police station and lodged a formal complaint. The complaint also states that Diwan also raped the victim on another couple of occasions at his friend’s place. Subsequently, the police nabbed Diwan. Commenting on the incident, Superintendent of Police (SP) P N Kataria said, “We have launched a further probe into this case to determine whether the accused has inflicted such horrendous acts against any other such victims. We are also probing if any other accomplices are involved in this heinous act.”",baroda

The J P Road police submitted an affidavit in court stating that abducted broker Jepal Patel has been admitted to hospital due to injuries sustained during his abduction, and the accused should not be granted bail as they pose danger to the victim. However, the police failed to mention that Mohsin was associated with Bichhu gang member and history-sheeter Munna Tarbuch. The police also refrained from disclosing the main accused’s close ties with the BJP. As per his social media account, his posts claim a BJP bigwig and an MLA is his ‘guru’. As the main accused Mohsin is a BJP worker with connections to politicians, the police are likely to be under political pressure. The police, however, argued in court that if the accused is released on bail, he might attack Jepal and his family again.

The CWC teams, stationed in Vadodara for the past four days, have been collecting crucial data on rainfall and flood patterns over the last 25 years. This comprehensive data collection is expected to assist in planning future flood mitigation efforts. Sources said that the teams have focused on key reservoirs such as Ajwa, Pratappura, Haripura, Vadadala, and Dhanera to assess the city’s vulnerabilities. The teams also conducted a detailed inspection of the Ajwa and Pratappura lakes and the Vishwamitri River, which played a significant role in the recent flooding. In a meeting chaired by former Union Secretary Navlawala, state officials discussed vital projects, including the proposed Vishwamitri project. The aim is to ensure that such floods do not occur again. Officials believe that the steps suggested by the CWC will help Vadodara become better equipped to handle potential future floods. Earlier, the state Industries and Mines Department announced the compensation package to assist micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), local businesses, and voluntary organisations affected by the floods. Street vendors who operate carts will receive ₹5,000 in financial assistance, while those with cabins up to 40 square feet in size will receive ₹20,000. For businesses operating from cabins larger than 40 square feet, the assistance will be ₹40,000. Additionally, small and medium enterprises with pucca shops and a monthly turnover of up to ₹5 lakh will receive ₹85,000 in compensation. The government has also committed to facilitating soft loans for shops with a monthly turnover exceeding ₹5 lakh to help them recover from the flood-induced losses.

Chasing a target of 262, Mumbai had ended Day 3 on 42/2, losing key wickets of Prithvi Shaw and Hardik Tamore. With the defending champions still in contention, captain Ajinkya Rahane and Ayush Mhatre were expected to provide some stability. However, Bhatt quickly turned the tide in Baroda’s favour, dismissing both Rahane and Mhatre early on Day 4, giving a critical blow to Mumbai’s hopes. Shreyas Iyer, who is eyeing a comeback to the Indian national team, then partnered with Siddhesh Lad, attempting to steady the innings. The pair put together a 41-run stand and looked poised to revive Mumbai’s chase. But Bhatt returned to snare the vital wicket of Iyer, who was dismissed for 30, a turning point in the game that opened up Mumbai’s lower order. With the pressure mounting, Bhatt struck again, removing Shams Mulani and Shardul Thakur, leaving Mumbai’s tail exposed. Despite Lad’s valiant efforts, scoring 59 off 94 balls, Mumbai found themselves on the back foot as wickets continued to tumble at the other end. Tanush Kotian and Mohit Avasthi failed to provide the necessary support, and Bhatt eventually claimed the final wicket of the match, dismissing Lad and sealing the win for Baroda. Earlier, Baroda in their first innings scored 290, courtesy of Mitesh Patel 86 and Atit Seth 66 as Tanush Kotoan clinched four while Shams Mulani bagged three wickets for Mumbai. Ayush Mhatre on his debut Ranji match scored 52 and was the highest scorer for Mumbai in the first innings as Bhatt's four wickets and Akash Singh's three restricted Mumbai on 214.

Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Pranav Trivedi came down hard on the firm, saying that the court should not be played with. “This is not a chess board,” said the court over the absence of the representatives from the Kotia Projects. The court had summoned the firm to decide upon the compensation to be paid to the victims’ families, out of the firm’s pockets. The court had also ordered the Collector of Vadodara to file a report with information about the victims and the injured. The High Court urged the Vadodara Collector to submit the report with all the details including the name, age, address, extent and type of injury of the victims and the injured. During the hearing of the writ of public interest in the Vadodara Harni lake boat accident, Vineet Kotia, a retired director of Kotia Project, and his lawyer appeared and tried to defend that he had retired before this incident took place and he has no responsibility for this incident. However, the Chief Justice directly asked the lawyer if they had a power of attorney to appear from Kotia Projects and file an affidavit. The High Court made Kotia Projects a party in this case and issued a notice to them a month and a half ago but no appearance has been made by them yet. Earlier, four members from the firm had appeared before the court, but the court had asked all 13 partners to be present. Also read: Harni boat tragedy: HC grants bail to five accused",baroda
Gujarat HC rejects Wadi Swaminarayan priest’s bail plea in rape case,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-high-court-reject-wadi-swaminarayan-priest-bail-plea-case,2024-10-20,20,10,2024,"Wadi Swaminarayan Temple Gujarat High Court has denied anticipatory bail to Wadi’s J P Swami alias Jagat Pawandas Swami in the rape case of a minor in Vadodara in 2016. Around a decade ago, the priest of Wadi Swaminarayan Temple, associated with the Vadtal sect, allegedly abused and raped a 16-year-old daughter of his disciple. On June 8, the girl, now 23 years old, lodged a complaint at Vadodara’s Wadi police station. At that time, the accused Swami called around 10.30 pm on the survivor’s father’s mobile. Swami and the survivor used to chat through WhatsApp on her father’s phone. On September 10, 2016, J P Swami asked the survivor to visit a room in the temple at night. Swami raped her in his room and threatened to kill her entire family if she disclosed the matter to anyone. Later, Swami also blackmailed her and asked her to send obscene pictures and videos of her, to which she obliged under pressure. Shockingly, a day after he raped her, Swami handed a contraceptive pill to her. As per his instructions, the survivor took the pill. After being denied bail by a Vadodara court, Swami moved the HC. Here, he had pleaded, “The complainant has filed a false complaint. The complaint was filed eight years after the incident in question.” Slamming his bail plea, the prosecution stated, “At the time of the incident, the girl was a minor (15 years old). The accused inflicted a heinous act upon her that tarnished the sanctity of a saint.” The prosecution further argued, “There is strong evidence against the accused. A 92-page WhatsApp chat was also presented before the court, which established the relationship between J P Swami and the girl. Given the gravity of the crime against the accused, he should not be granted anticipatory bail under any circumstances, as there is a possibility of him fleeing the country.” As per the complaint, it all began in 2014 when Jagat Pawan Swami, the then Kathori Swami of Wadi Swaminarayan temple used to stare at the survivor when she was studying in Class 10 and visited the temple. The survivor and complainant who lodged an FIR after eight years said, “I did not tell about this to my parents as the Swami had my obscene videos and photos. I did not complain as I lacked the source. My parents are unaware of this complaint.” According to reports, J P Swami discontinued contact with the survivor after his transfer from Wadi on November 30, 2019. Agreeing with the arguments made by the prosecution, the HC dismissed Swami’s bail plea. Also read: Swaminarayan temple priest rapes, blackmails girl, complaint filed after eight years",baroda

The accused, who fled the scene following the accident, was traced and apprehended through technical surveillance and human intelligence. The accident occurred on June 17 this year, on S G Highway near Rajpath Club in Ahmedabad, where Jaysukh Vaghela (51) and his wife Raksha Vaghela (48) were hit by an unidentified speeding vehicle while crossing the road. Jaysukh succumbed to his injuries, while Raksha was hospitalised with severe head and body injuries. The driver responsible for the incident fled immediately, evading initial detection. Vadodara’s Traffic Police launched a thorough investigation, reviewing 80 CCTV footage from surrounding areas to identify the vehicle and its driver. Although no footage was available from the immediate accident site, cameras further away captured a suspicious motorcycle, leading investigators to the culprit. Four months after the case was filed, the police located the motorcycle and arrested the suspect. Hit-and-run accidents in Gujarat have claimed more than 3,400 lives over the past years, with a rise in such cases reported annually. The Gujarat Assembly was informed in 2023 that 4,860 hit-and-run incidents occurred between 2020-21 and 2022-23, resulting in 3,449 fatalities and leaving 2,720 people injured.

A city BJP leader, Chandu Solanki, organised a fast unto death today demanding recruitment of the sanitation workers, whom he says were “on war footing during the Vadodara floods and COVID-19 pandemic.” A union of sanitation workers declared a strike against the VMC 15 days ago, which has now been reinforced by Solanki’s fast. He carried out a protest with a copy of the constitution, acting as a symbol of Babasaheb Ambedkar’s legacy. Taking a jibe, the BJP leader said, “Although PM Modi openly washes the feet of dalit women, his party members in Vadodara are doing injustice to sanitation workers.” A contractor had misled the workers in Vadodara with an excuse of having deployed sanitation workers from Ahmedabad. Major lapses are also alleged in their wage payments. Notably, Ahmedabad had earlier outsourced sanitation services. It even hired consultants—at a cost of ₹1.25 crore—to help make Ahmedabad the cleanest city by 2026. Earlier this year, a matter in the Supreme Court was taken up, where the Apex Court came down heavily on the Gujarat government for appealing against a Gujarat High Court order to regularise the services of a sanitation worker.

The Food and Drugs Control Administration (FDCA) launched raids at four shops in the Hathikhana wholesale market, during which chilli powder was seized from one establishment. The officials have sent chilli powder samples for laboratory testing to determine their quality. This latest incident has again cast a shadow over the Hathikhana market, which has been scrutinised for previous cases involving questionable food products. As part of routine checks during festival seasons, the Health Department dispatched select personnel to inspect various food and beverage outlets. During the raids, a significant quantity of adulterated chilli powder was discovered at a wholesale spice merchant, raising concerns among authorities about the quality control measures in place. Mangub Rathva, the municipal food safety officer, confirmed that the operation focused on the Madhuban shop based on instructions to sample coloured mouth fresheners. However, no such items were found, leading to the discovery of the chilli powder, valued at ₹1.83 lakh. Further investigations were underway, as additional adulterated spice items were also identified during the inspections. In a series of other raids, the FDCA has seized adulterated food products across Gujarat. In February, authorities confiscated 10,000 litres of adulterated milk in Palanpur and Gandhinagar. This milk, mixed with maltodextrin powder, was intended for distribution to a local firm. Continuing to ensure food safety, the FDCA reported a massive seizure in May 2024 involving 107,122 kg of adulterated milk and milk products. Additionally, in March 2024, more than 2,000 kg of adulterated chilli powder was seized in Gujarat, further highlighting the ongoing battle against food adulteration in the state. The crackdown on adulteration was not limited to dairy products. In December 2023, the FDCA seized 8,467 kg of adulterated ghee valued at approximately Rs 30 lakh. The ghee was found to contain soybean oil, vegetable oil, palm oil, and artificial ghee flavouring.

Notably, Vadodara has received the highest approvals, with 25 schools granting permission for the fee hike. Establishing the FRC aims to prevent arbitrary fee increases by regional schools. Operating from the DEO office in Vadodara, the committee oversees fee-related decisions for private schools in seven districts: Vadodara, Anand, Kheda, Dahod, Mahisagar, Panchmahal, and Chhotaudepur. However, the Vadodara Parents’ Association allegations previously claimed that the FRC has been lax in enforcing fee regulations. In its recent decision, the FRC approved a 5 per cent increase for 76 schools, which has sparked optimism among school operators still in line for similar fee hikes. The approvals are broken down as follows: 25 schools in Vadodara, 0 in Anand, 12 in Kheda, 6 in Dahod, 7 in Mahisagar, 24 in Panchmahal, and 2 in Chhotaudepur, highlighting Vadodara’s position as having the most private schools awaiting fee hike approvals. Looking ahead, sources indicate that once the provisional fees are determined, school administrators can file appeals before the final fee structure is confirmed. It is common for schools to request increases greater than 5 per cent, leaving it to be seen which institutions will proceed with appeals in the coming days. Gujarat has over 32,000 government primary schools, alongside the establishment of 84 model schools aimed at enhancing educational quality in the state. As of December 2023, only one teacher was staffed 1,606 of these government primary schools. In response to the ongoing teacher shortage, the Gujarat government has implemented various measures, including appointing contractual teachers and organising teacher transfer camps to allocate teaching resources better. Initiated in 2014, the model schools in Gujarat aim to provide high-quality education within the government school system. Currently, 84 model schools across the state cater to upper primary, secondary, and higher secondary classes.

"Congress, Karni Sena allege suppression of opposing voices as PM Modi visits Gujarat",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/congress-karni-sena-allege-suppression-of-opposing-voices-pm-narendra-modi-visits-gujarat,2024-10-28,28,10,2024,"PM Modi in Gujarat Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to his ‘home state’ on Monday has stirred a major controversy, as several opposing voices from the Karni Sena and the Congress Party have been detained and kept under house arrest. Modi is visiting Gujarat with his Spanish counterpart, Pedro Sanchez. The delegation jointly inaugurated the TATA Aircraft Complex in Vadodara. However, the Karni Sena has levelled serious accusations against the government, alleging that their spokesperson, Mahendrasinh Rathod, has been under police protection since Sunday afternoon, restricting his movements ahead of the PM’s visit. Rathod has been a prominent voice against the administrative failure to save Vadodara from the flood menace during monsoons. Two police personnel have been accompanying Rathod, even during his visit to a factory in the Gorwa area to address the workers’ wage-related issues. Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee President and Rajya Sabha MP, Shaktisinh Gohil, took to X to voice this issue, stating, “Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi, upon your arrival in Gujarat, I would like to inform you that many social activists (citizens) in Vadodara have been under house arrest since yesterday by your police.” Reflecting on what the city endured during floods, Gohil said, “Had you visited Vadodara when the Vishwamitri river overflowed and caused devastation, you would have witnessed the true situation. I request you to remove encroachments on natural water drainage paths and issue orders for appropriate compensation.” Advocating for the state’s farmers, Gohil urged the PM, “Today, farmers are facing immense difficulties. When farmers are being forced to commit suicide, it is essential to provide them with adequate compensation. Even in the ₹350 crore announcement made in August, farmers have been deceived. I demand that the government generously assist farmers, traders, slum dwellers, and citizens whose homes have been damaged and provide appropriate compensation for the losses. There has also been a huge loss in the name of crop insurance. Why have farmers been excluded from the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme?” After inaugurating the aircraft manufacturing facility in Vadodara, Modi is slated to visit Amreli. Over his visit, Gujarat Pradesh Mahila Congress faction president Jenny Thummar posted on X on Sunday, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji is arriving in Amreli tomorrow, and today one after another, our workers are being arrested. We can understand if they were merely put under house arrest, but with what authority are they being directly arrested? It needs to be explained.” She also urged the party workers to submit their videos from the jail.",baroda

As per the complaint by Karjan police, thieves had removed the idol’s eyes, gold strips above the ‘tilak’, and cash from the donation box at a Jain Derasar near Dethan village in Vadodara’s Karjan. The probe led the police to establish that the Garasiya gang, based in Sirohi’s Pindwara taluka in Rajasthan, was behind this theft. A police team went to Sirohi and nabbed Lalaram Sohan and Sunilal alias Sinaram Sisodiya, based on specific information. Their interrogation revealed that Sohan worked as a labourer and polished stones at temples. His peers, who held the same occupation, used to travel to Gujarat for temple polishing work. Sohan followed them to Gujarat and kept a mental note of the remote temples he worked at. He then located these Jain ‘Derasars’ and other temples through the help of Google Maps and came down with his accomplices equipped with iron rods and screwdrivers, among other tools. He would break into these temples, steal ornaments and other precious items, as well as cash from the donation box, and abscond without a trace.

The primary focus of the institute is education in information technology, with courses in Computer Science and Information Technology, as well as M Tech and Ph D programs. The Gujarat government initially planned to allocate land for the institute in Padra but later changed its decision and allocated 62 acres in Dumad. However, the campus is still not operational due to slow progress in construction.

Illicit liquor valued at ₹6.89 lakh seized; one arrested in Gujarat’s Vadodara,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/illicit-liquor-valued-at-6-89-lakh-seized-one-arrested-in-gujarats-vadodara,2025-02-19,19,02,2025,"Illicit liquor valued at ₹6.89 lakh was seized in the Bapod police station area in Gujarat’s Vadodara, officials said on Wednesday. During the operation, one accused was arrested, while two others, including a suspect from Rajasthan and an unknown container driver, were declared wanted, the officials added. Acting on a tip-off, a police team raided a warehouse opposite Marutidham Society and found an illegal liquor stockpile. The premises were linked to Suvalal Panchal, a repeat offender previously arrested for similar prohibition violations. Panchal, a resident of Jivan Nagar, Waghodia Road, Vadodara, was arrested. The raid led to the seizure of foreign liquor, mobile phones, and cash, amounting to a total seizure of approximately ₹7 lakh. While Panchal was arrested, searches were underway to arrest the other two accused. Despite Gujarat’s prohibition of alcohol since 1948, the state continues to grapple with significant challenges related to illegal liquor activities. In the first half of 2024, the State Monitoring Cell (SMC) conducted 224 raids across various districts and cities, achieving 180 successful operations. These efforts led to the seizure of approximately Rs 11.5 crore worth of liquor and an additional Rs 26 crore in illegal goods. Notably, Ahmedabad reported the highest number of prohibition cases among the state's four police commissionerates, with 17 cases, followed by Surat with 13, Vadodara with five, and none in Rajkot. This trend mirrors data from 2023, where Ahmedabad accounted for 37 out of 83 liquor-related cases registered by the SMC. Comparatively, in 2021, the SMC conducted 148 successful raids throughout the year, seizing ₹13.64 crore worth of liquor and ₹6.90 crore in illegal goods. The increase in enforcement activities over the years underscores the ongoing efforts to combat illicit liquor operations in the state.

Eight Vadodara jail inmates to appear in Gujarat Board exams,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/eight-vadodara-jail-inmates-to-appear-in-gujarat-board-exams,2025-02-23,23,02,2025,"The Vadodara jail in Gujarat is witnessing a unique academic spirit. Eight inmates have geared up to appear for board exams this year – four for Class 10 and four for Class 12. Jail authorities believe that providing an educational environment helps inmates reintegrate into society with purpose and skills, reducing the chances of reoffending. According to Welfare Officer Mahesh Rathod, some inmates appearing for the Class 12 exams are in their late twenties and voluntarily opted to continue their education. Having completed Class 11 before incarceration, they now aim to pass their board exams and later pursue higher education through IGNOU. Alongside formal studies, the inmates receive vocational training in carpentry, welding, tailoring, and plumbing, equipping them with skills that improve their chances of securing employment post-release. Last year, five inmates appeared for the Class 12 exams, of which four passed and are now pursuing graduation. Authorities stress that creating a structured learning environment inside prisons ensures that inmates leave with knowledge and skills rather than returning to a cycle of crime. By focusing on rehabilitation through education, the prison system aims to turn incarceration into an opportunity for transformation, proving that second chances can lead to a new beginning. In Gujarat, prison authorities have implemented educational programmes enabling inmates to appear for board examinations, facilitating their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. These initiatives, often in collaboration with the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSEB), allow inmates to pursue formal education while serving their sentences. Over the years, there has been a notable increase in inmate participation in these examinations. In 2016, approximately 134 inmates appeared for Class 10 and Class 12 board exams. This number rose to 155 in 2017 and further to 183 in 2018, with 155 inmates taking the Class 10 exam and 28 appearing for the Class 12 exam. In 2024, nine prisoners serving life sentences at Surat's Lajpore Central Jail successfully cleared the GSEB Class 12 examinations, reflecting the positive impact of educational opportunities within the prison system.

100-day project launched to prevent flooding in Vadodara’s Vishwamitri river,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/100-day-project-launched-to-prevent-flooding-in-vadodaras-vishwamitri-river,2025-02-24,24,02,2025,"The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) in Gujarat has initiated steps to prevent flooding in the Vishwamitri River. An official said that the excavation work for a buffer pond has commenced at Dena, the confluence of the Vishwamitri and Surya rivers. He added that the project is expected to continue for the next 100 days. Officials believe that the pond will not only aid in flood prevention but also serve as a valuable water resource. Shital Mistri, Chairman of the VMC Standing Committee, informed that the municipality had acquired land near the Surya River in Dena back in 1970 for brick kilns. Of the seven hectares owned by the corporation, five hectares have been designated for the buffer pond excavation, which has been assigned to a contractor. The pond will be dug to a depth of 5.5 to 8 meters to ensure water flow from the Surya River, thereby creating a buffer lake along its banks. This reservoir may also serve as a drinking water source in the future. Additionally, as part of a larger plan, this pond will be interconnected with other lakes to enhance water storage capacity and mitigate flooding in the Vishwamitri River. Authorities estimate that the buffer pond will have the capacity to store 25 crore litres of water. Municipal Commissioner Dilip Rana stated that the buffer lake would be constructed on municipal land near the confluence of the Vishwamitri and Surya rivers. The project involves excavating around two lakh cubic meters of soil, with completion expected within two and a half to three months. This pond is expected to play a crucial role in controlling river flooding while also serving as a long-term water source for the city. More recently, the 2024 floods in late August were among the worst the state has seen in recent years. A rare atmospheric phenomenon, involving a deep depression over land, caused unprecedented rainfall across various districts, including Vadodara, Jamnagar, Dwarka, Rajkot, Morbi, and Bhuj. The Vishwamitri River in Vadodara overflowed, leading to extensive urban flooding. By early September 2024, Gujarat had received 118 per cent of its seasonal monsoon rainfall, displacing over 20,000 people and severely damaging infrastructure and agricultural land. Navsari district recorded the highest rainfall in August 2024 at 356 mm, followed by Dangs (290 mm) and Vadodara (270 mm). The state witnessed extensive flooding, disrupting normal life and forcing authorities to take emergency measures. Historical flood data suggests that Gujarat experiences, on average, four major flood events per decade, highlighting the urgent need for improved flood management and mitigation strategies to protect lives and property.

"Gujarat’s 50,000 boating families struggle as strict regulations take a toll",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarats-50000-boating-families-struggle-as-strict-regulations-take-a-toll,2025-02-24,24,02,2025,"After the horrific Harni boat accident that claimed the lives of 12 students and two teachers in Vadodara last year, the Gujarat government implemented strict regulations for boating activities. This has affected around 50,000 families who rely on boating and fishing activities for their livelihood near religious sites . On behalf of these families, a request has been made to the Gujarat government to relax these rules. One of the key regulations mandates that boat drivers (pilots) must obtain a licence. However, there is no authority in Gujarat that provides such a licence, similar to how the RTO issues driving licences for vehicles. Additionally, a licence is required from boat manufacturers. In Gujarat, most boats operating near religious sites and used for fishing are sourced from the Alang shipyard. These boats are originally manufactured in countries such as  France or Italy. The major question is how would poor boat operators obtain a licence from these countries. Some boats are even handmade at the local level and do not have any institutional certification. Apart from this, a fitness certificate for boats has been made mandatory, which must be obtained from a government-approved organisation at a high cost. There are other requirements such as fire extinguishers, lifeboats, chains, anchor tests, annual surveys, monthly maintenance, maintenance-related photos and video documentation, insurance, and more. These regulations have become a major burden on the poor and people engaged in the boating business. The rules are not only stringent but also said to be impractical. According to former Vadodara mayor Dr Rajendra Singh Rathod, boating activities continue in Kevadia, Sabarmati, Dwarka, and Saputara. Boats also operate for pilgrimages to places like Shuklatirth and Kabirvad. He alleged that illegal collections (extortion) are prevalent in boats involved in river sand mining. He has demanded that the government ease the regulations for small-scale boat operators to grant them approval, thereby alleviating the financial distress of 50,000 affected families. Narmada river bank villages face economic hardships In the villages along the Narmada river bank in Vadodara district, boats are a means of livelihood. However, following the boat tragedy at Harni Lake in Vadodara, there has been a year-long ban on boat operations. This has severely impacted the livelihoods of over a thousand boatmen families in the pilgrimage sites of Chandod, Karnali, Shinor, Malsar, Nanderiya in Dabhoi taluka, and Nareshwar and Moti Koral in Karjan taluka. These families are facing unemployment, and the situation has deteriorated to the point where they are struggling to afford two meals a day. Boatmen from the Chandod area state that they had purchased 850 life jackets and lifeguard rings a year ago and distributed them among the 103 boats in Chandod. However, the ban has not yet been lifted, leaving them unemployed. Moreover, in Karjan taluka, boatmen report that the boat ferry service at Nareshwar, Moti Koral, and Kohona Ghat was banned after the Harni boat tragedy. This ban is still in effect, cutting off the boatmen families’ source of income.

The drug manufacturers had sold MD drugs worth ₹3.5 crore just eight days ago, as per reports. Notably, the district SOG staff raided the farm of Jagdish Mahida on the road from Moksi to Raniya on Saturday evening. They seized 3.379 kg of MD drugs worth ₹3.37 crore and arrested both Mahida and Premchandkumar Mahanto (a resident of Parkwood, Palmwood, Panchvati in Gorwa), who were involved in drug production. During the police investigation, it was found that Mahida, along with one Chirag Patel, started producing MD drugs with the assistance of Mahanto. Chemicals were sourced externally to manufacture the MD drug. Just eight days ago, 200 grams of MD drugs were sold to Patel. On Thursday, 186 grams of MD drugs were sold to Vipulsingh, a native of Aurangabad residing in Morbi, along with another person. The total value of the drugs sold to these two individuals amounted to approximately ₹3.5 crore. Mahida and Mahanto were presented before the court on Tuesday. The police requested a 14-day remand, but the court granted an 11-day remand. The police raised several crucial questions before the court, including identifying the main accused, the extent of the drug racket, and whether MD drug production was carried out earlier. Mahida and Patel previously worked together at a company named BetaBlue in the outskirts of Moksi village two years ago. A year ago, Patel brought the necessary equipment to Mahida’s home and attempted to produce MD drugs. However, the final product failed, so they kept the batch at home. Three months ago, Patel brought Mahanto along, and for the past three months, the drug production process had been ongoing. During the raid, police found a crude bill listing various chemical names inside the back cover of a mobile phone seized from the accused. Since Mahanto himself is a chemist, he personally processed the chemicals to manufacture MD drugs. The police stated that on February 17, chemicals were purchased from a shop named ‘Sameer Traders’ in Chhani, and Mahanto processed them under Mahida’s instructions to produce MD drugs. Mahida, a resident of Jalaram Colony in Moksi village, was also arrested in 2014 in an MD drug case by the CID Crime Unit. After two individuals from Anand district were caught with 500 grams of MD drugs in Ahmedabad, Mahida’s name surfaced as their supplier, leading to his arrest. At that time, Mahida spent nine months in Sabarmati Jail before being acquitted.",baroda

Under tight police security, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation removed unauthorised sheds and encroachments outside the residence of Firozabanu and her son, Sultan Ajmeri, in the Santosh Nagar area of Tandaljar, officials said on Friday. This move is part of a broader statewide crackdown on anti-social elements initiated by the government. As part of this campaign, authorities first compiled a list of notorious offenders followed by the removal of their illegal encroachments. Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Abhay Soni informed the media that Firozabanu has multiple cases registered against her under the Prohibition Act and had previously been detained under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities (PASA) Act. He stated that the bootlegger had illegally occupied municipal land outside her house in Santosh Nagar, and the police were acting to remove the encroachment. “We are systematically clearing illegal encroachments. Yesterday, a similar operation was carried out against two bootleggers in Atladara, and today, the action is taking place in Tandalja. Town planning officials are assisting in this operation to ensure the removal is carried out in accordance with legal procedures,” said DCP Soni. Municipal officer Mehul Solanki stated that prior notices had been issued regarding the illegal sheds and platforms outside the residence. These structures have now been demolished, and further action regarding the main building will be taken after serving legal notices. “For now, we are acting based on police recommendations at designated locations. A wider drive will follow to remove remaining encroachments in the area,” Solanki added. Gujarat, despite its longstanding prohibition on alcohol, continues to grapple with a significant bootlegging problem. As of April 2024, approximately 42,000 bootleggers were reported to be active across the state. Notably, in the Ahmedabad district, nearly 60 per cent of these illicit liquor sellers are women, highlighting a substantial female involvement in this underground industry. The state has witnessed tragic incidents resulting from the consumption of spurious liquor. In July 2022, a methanol poisoning event led to at least 42 deaths and over 97 hospitalizations. Similarly, in 2009, Gujarat experienced another mass poisoning, resulting in the death of 136 people from consuming bootleg liquor. In response to these challenges, the Gujarat government has intensified its crackdown on illegal alcohol activities. In 2023 alone, authorities recorded 466 prohibition violations and seized liquor worth ₹20 crore. To further deter bootlegging, the state Assembly amended the Prohibition Act in 2024, empowering the government to auction vehicles used to transport liquor even before court verdicts are pronounced.

The 26-year-old man, a resident of a village in Waghodia taluka of Vadodara, has been served a notice to appear before the Mumbai Police for questioning. On Sunday, Khan received a death threat via a message sent to the official WhatsApp number of the Worli Transport Department. The threat came exactly a year after two unidentified men on a motorcycle fired four shots outside his Bandra residence. Following the latest threat, Worli police registered a case and upgraded security arrangements at the actor’s home in Galaxy Apartments. According to the message, the sender threatened to either storm Khan’s residence or target his vehicle with explosives.

"MSU lecturer discovers new species of sunflower, among 70 now found in south Gujarat",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/msu-lecturer-discovers-new-species-of-sunflower-among-70-now-found-in-south-gujarat,2025-04-20,20,04,2025,"Dr Jaydeep Sharma, a researcher and lecturer in the Botany Department of the Faculty of Science at The Maharaja Sayajirao University, completed his PhD on sunflowers, uncovering several fascinating facts during his research. Under the guidance of senior professor Dr P Nagar, Dr Jaydeep Sharma conducted a study of the rich biodiversity in the Sahyadri mountain ranges of south Gujarat, covering five districts—Surat, Tapi, Dang, Valsad, and Navsari. Through this study, it was discovered that there are around 70 species of sunflowers in south Gujarat, including one newly identified species. According to Dr Sharma, it is a common belief that sunflower flowers are yellow and withstand intense sunlight. However, not all sunflower family species have yellow flowers. Also, what appears to be a single flower is actually a cluster of 5 to 50 tiny flowers arranged in a way that gives the illusion of one large bloom. Before this research, 56 species were documented in the region; Dr Sharma discovered 14 more, bringing the total to 70 species in south Gujarat. Among these is a new species with white flowers tinged with pink, which has been recognised internationally as a new species. It has been named after the renowned Gujarati botanist Jaykishan Thakkar. The group of researchers studying sunflower species worldwide is known as the International Compositae Alliance, comprising around 100 members. Dr Sharma is the only Indian member of this alliance, representing the Botany Department of the MS University. Facts about sunflowers Sunflower species include herbs, vines, and plants as tall as six feet. Many such tall plants are found in south Gujarat. Sunflowers are among the fastest-adapting plants in nature’s evolutionary process. Five species are rapidly adapting to the current climate change conditions. Economically, sunflowers are very important. They are cultivated extensively for sunflower oil. Bhringraj, used for hair care, is also a type of sunflower species. Leaves of a species known as Kapuriya provide skin protection against mosquitoes. South Gujarat hosts sunflower species ranging in size from flowers with a diameter of half a foot to those barely half a millimeter in size. Across all of Gujarat, 101 sunflower species have been documented.",baroda
