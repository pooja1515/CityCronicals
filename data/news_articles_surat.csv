Nilesh Kumbhani faces nomination cancellation in Surat Lok Sabha seat,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/nilesh-kumbhani-faces-nomination-cancellation-in-surat-lok-sabha-seat,2024-04-21,21,04,2024,"Ahead of Lok Sabha and bye polls in Gujarat, Congress faces a big blow as Surat candidate Nilesh Kumbhani’s nomination has been cancelled. After a brief stir regarding the disqualification of Kumbhani on Apr 19, the hearing in the case of Kumbhani concluded today at Surat collector Sourabh Pardhi’s office, and the nomination was cancelled. Earlier, the vice president of the Gujarat Congress and lawyer, Babu Mangukiya, appearing in defence of Kumbhani, said that all four of our supporters of Kumbhani have been abducted. On the other hand, Surat Congress leader Aslam Cyclewala alleged that Kumbhani had made a ticket deal under the table. The nomination has been invalidated by the election officer, as Ramesh Palara, Jagdish Savaliya, and Dhruvin Dhameliya, three of his proposers, claimed they had not signed the form of Kumbhani. According to reports, the Congress will now contest 23 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat. Congress is likely to move to the Gujarat High Court regarding the cancellation of nominations.

BJP opens account as Surat Lok Sabha seat declared uncontested,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/bjp-wins-surat-seat-uncontested-mukesh-dalal-declared-winner,2024-04-22,22,04,2024,"Mukesh Dalal The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has sealed its first victory for the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from Surat constituency, as the seat was declared unopposed today. The Congress party faced a major setback in the general elections in Gujarat as the Returning Officer rejecting its candidates' nomination forms on Apr 21. Moreover, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate, Pyarelal Bharti, also revoked his candidature from the seat. While in most constituencies of Gujarat the fight is mainly between two parties, the Congress and the BJP, in Surat the BJP now has a clear path. Surat drama for Congress’ Nilesh Kumbhani The Congress’ Nilesh Kumbhani, who was initially nominated for the Surat Lok Sabha constituency, found his candidacy invalidated after alleged discrepancies were discovered in the proposers' signatures. The Congress’ backup candidate Suresh Padsala also met the same fate, effectively removing the grand old party from the electoral contest in this key city. The decision was announced by the district Returning Officer, Sourabh Pardhi, who noted that the signatures on the nomination forms needed to be more genuine. The proposers denied having signed the forms themselves. The controversy arose just after Dinesh Jodhani, the election agent for the BJP candidate Mukesh Dalal, raised objections. In response, Kumbhani defended the authenticity of the signatures, suggesting that a handwriting expert and the signatories verify them. Despite these efforts, the Returning Officer confirmed the rejections based on the affidavits and additional evidence presented during the scrutiny. The Congress party, represented by its lawyer Babu Mangukiya, plans to challenge the decision in the higher courts. Mukesh Dalal, the BJP candidate, remains a contender in Surat. A veteran in local politics, Dalal has held significant positions, including Chairman of the Surat Municipal Corporation's Standing Committee and current General Secretary of the BJP's city unit. His extensive experience and deep roots in the community make him a strong candidate for the seat. Surat is responsible for three-quarters of the world's diamond cutting and polishing trade. The Congress party, led by late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, reclaimed the Surat seat in 1980 and maintained its hold in the 1984 elections. However, the tide turned in 1989 when the BJP made its mark with Kashiram Rana securing the seat, initiating a series of victories in 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2004. In a notable 2009 election, BJP's Darshana Jardosh became the first female MP from Surat. This constituency, which comprises Assembly seats in Olpad, Varachha Road, Surat West, Surat East, Karanj, Surat North, and Katargam, continued to favour the BJP. In 2019, Darshana Vikram Jardosh secured a decisive win with 795,651 votes, significantly ahead of the Congress' Ashok Patel, who garnered 247,421 votes. Similarly, in the 2014 elections, Jardosh won with 718,412 votes, while the Congress' Bhupat Bhai Desai trailed with 185,222 votes. Surat Lok Sabha constituency has a notable political heritage, having been represented by some prominent figures. Veteran BJP leader Kashiram Rana notably served as the MP from Surat for six terms, demonstrating the party's strong influence in the region. Additionally, the constituency boasts a distinguished history with Morarji Desai, the 7th Prime Minister of India, who served as its MP for five terms. Since 1989, the constituency has consistently elected BJP leaders with substantial margins.

Surat Congress leader Nilesh Kumbhani ‘vanishes’ amid election controversy,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/surat-congress-leader-nilesh-kumbhani-vanishes-amid-election-controversy,2024-04-23,23,04,2024,"Nilesh Kumbhani Congress leader Nilesh Kumbhani from Surat, whose Lok Sabha candidacy was recently cancelled due to inconsistencies in his nomination form, seems to have ‘vanished’ into thin air. Kumbhani is not reachable on phone, raising alarms within his party and among his followers. The development follows the Election Commission declaring BJP’s Mukesh Dalal as the unopposed winner from the Surat Lok Sabha seat after all the other candidates withdrew their nominations. “Kumbhani is neither at his home, nor is he taking calls. He also didn’t contact any party workers since the election of Mukesh Dalal,” a Congress worker said. After rumours that Kumbhani may switch allegiance to the BJP, several Congress supporters staged a demonstration outside his residence with posters labelling him a “betrayer of the people”. Recently, the returning officer (RO), Surat collector Sourabh Pardhi, rejected the nomination of Kumbhani and his substitute candidate due to alleged discrepancies in the signatures of their proposers. The candidatures were dismissed under Section 36(2) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which permits the RO to examine and reject nominations based on valid objections. The situation escalated after eight other candidates, including Pyarelal Bharati of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), withdrew their nominations under unclear circumstances, leaving Dalal as the lone contender. The series of withdrawals prompted allegations of foul play, with Gujarat Congress chief Shaktisinh Gohil claiming that Kumbhani’s nomination was sabotaged by the BJP as he described the incident as a “murder of democracy”.

The party has now reached out to the election commission and even protested against Kumbhani. The BJP filed a counter-application against Congress candidate Nilesh Kumbhani, which resulted in the cancellation of his nomination form on Apr 21. After his rejection, eight other candidates withdrew their nominations, leaving Dalal as the sole remaining candidate for the seat and its imminent winner. Over this row, the Congress has now reached out to the Election Commission, alleging that Dalal was declared the winner over undue influence. Congress demands fresh elections be held in this constituency. A delegation of Congress leaders met with the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and other election officials, urging the electoral process in Surat to be re-conducted. A Congress spokesperson mentioned that four supporters nominated Kumbhani. However, without any prior intimation, all four of them filed affidavits stating false signatures. This could not be a coincidence, said the spokesperson. They added that Kumbhani was missing for a few hours, and before they could locate him, all the other candidates withdrew their nominations, while Kumbhani’s form was rejected. Outrage against Nilesh Kumbhani Alongside the electoral setback, Nilesh Kumbhani has been facing strong opposition from his supporters as well. It is noteworthy that Kumbhani’s supporters in the nomination process were his nephew and partner. Some factions in the Congress party express suspicion over Kumbhani’s involvement in this fiasco. Congress party workers were seen flocking to Kumbhani’s residence in Surat this morning, carrying placards and banners reading ‘Traitor of the People, Murderer of Democracy’. The police have detained the protestors. Is Nilesh Kumbhani joining BJP? Amid all this, speculations have also been reportedly raised about Kumbhani switching to the BJP as early as the end of this week.

Amid rumours of Kumbhani's potential defection to the BJP, Congress supporters have staged protests outside his now-vacant residence, denouncing him as a ""betrayer of the people."" The posters, prominently displayed on the Hirabaug Bridge, were installed by former Corporator Dinesh Kachadiya. They urge the public to confront Kumbhani over his actions. This public display of dissent follows the controversial disqualification of Kumbhani's Lok Sabha candidacy by Surat Collector and Returning Officer, Sourabh Pardhi, amid claims of inconsistencies in his nomination documents. Kumbhani has since become unreachable, sparking concern among his party colleagues and supporters. ""He is neither at his home nor available on calls. He hasn’t contacted party members since the election of Mukesh Dalal,"" reported a Congress party worker. The situation escalated after Mukesh Dalal from the BJP was declared the winner unopposed in Surat, a result that came into place after all rival candidates, including those from major parties like the BSP, mysteriously withdrew their nominations. Returning Officer Sourabh Pardhi had rejected Kumbhani's nomination papers and that of his substitute, citing discrepancies in the signatures of their proposers. The controversy has fueled allegations of electoral manipulation by the BJP, with Gujarat Congress chief Shaktisinh Gohil condemning the episode as a ""murder of democracy"" and suggesting that the nomination process was sabotaged.

"Kumbhani not first, Congress’ Surat headache goes way back",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/nilesh-kumbhani-not-first-congress-surat-headache-goes-way-back,2024-04-25,25,04,2024,"Congress in Surat The invalidation of Congress’ Surat Lok Sabha candidate, Nilesh Kumbhani, led to eight more Surat candidates pulling out and BJP opening their account without breaking a sweat. This, however, is not the first blunder for Congress on the Surat seat, as the GOP has made such a mistake twice in the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) elections in 2000 and 2015. In the year 2000, forms for 23 Congress candidates were rejected altogether before the SMC elections. Patidar agitation failure Another such blunder was committed in 2015, during the peak of the Patidar reservation agitation in the state. During the days when the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAS) openly opposed the BJP and supported the Congress, it became extremely difficult for the saffron party to run campaigns in Surat wards. This resulted in the BJP being wiped out of the Patidar-dominated areas and the Congress winning a staggering 37 seats. With this impact solidifying Congress’ hold, the GOP was also certain to win the Patidar-dominated wards: Ward-2, Amroli, and Kosad. Karuna Bharat Rathod was the Congress’ candidate for this seat, reserved for the OBC (other backward classes), while the BJP fielded Urvashi Rami Mali for the SMC elections. In an embarrassing turn of events, Congress failed to submit an OBC certificate for their candidate along with the nomination form. The BJP took a stern objection over this, and Rathod’s form was rejected. The BJP candidate was similarly declared the unopposed winner even before the polling took place.

A video of Kumbhani surfaced today, where he said that he was ‘forced to come back’ due to the protests outside his house. He revealed that he had not gone absconding and was in constant contact with the Movdi Mandal. “I talked with Babubhai Mangukiya and told my family that Congress is with us, and we need not fear,” he is heard saying in the video. “With everyone’s cooperation, I went to Ahmedabad to file the petition, but Congress members protested against me at my home, forcing me to return,” stated the now ousted Congress leader. Kumbhani also mentioned Pratap Dudhat, who had earlier lashed out at him over his disqualification, did not pick up his calls and wasn’t even present while filing during the nomination. “When I had asked Dudhat to join me in rallies, he promised to accompany me when I file for the nomination. On his instructions, I chose a date to file the nomination after Amreli, but he stopped taking my calls.” Referring to Dudhat, Kumbhani said, “The one who talks about killing me today, had he been there while filing for the nomination, the situation would have been different.” Going after Congress leaders, Kumbhani stated that those protesting against him were involved with the BJP and weren’t there during the door-to-door campaigning. “They have done this before as well. I was left alone, and had to do everything by myself,” said Kumbhani. “No important names from Congress joined my rallies at the time of the campaign, too. The party had also asked for the booth details, and even with that no one came to help,” he said. “In the previous Vidhan Sabha elections, the BJP had asked many (Congress) leaders to notch down their campaigns, and they had obliged,” accused Kumbhani. Concluding his video, Kumbhani stated that he would not say anything that would hurt the Congress party. “I was, and will always be a soldier of Congress,” he said, ending the video. On Apr 20, Nilesh Kumbhani’s candidature for the Surat Lok Sabha constituency was cancelled when his supporters filed an affidavit stating their signatures on the nomination forms were forged. Following that, eight other candidates also pulled their nomination, serving BJP an uncontested first Lok Sabha victory on a platter.

The committee stated in a letter, “In the matter of the rejection of your (Nilesh Kumbhani’s) form, a situation of complete negligence on your part or your collusion with the BJP was clearly visible. Despite this, the disciplinary committee gave you enough time to come forward and present your side under the principles of natural justice. You must be aware that there is a lot of angst among the people of Surat as well as the Congress workers against you. You have been suspiciously absent and have not made any disclosure on your part, so the party has decided to suspend you for six years.” The letter also mentions, “The party had counted on you to raise your voice as the representative of Patidar communities and other people of Saurashtra who are based in Surat, but you have failed in doing so.” The disciplinary committee observed, “The rejection of the form is an extremely unfortunate incident.

Their efforts were crucial in securing AAP’s first major electoral success in Gujarat. However, both faced setbacks as they did not succeed in the 2022 assembly elections as AAP candidates. Their departure from AAP, announced on Apr 18, precedes their formal joining of the BJP, which will be held at Mangadh Chowk in Surat.

The Rajputs, opposing Parshottam Rupala, the BJP Lok Sabha candidate from Rajkot, flocked in huge numbers to yet another ‘Asmita Mahasammelan’ in south Gujarat. A huge number of saffron turban-clad Kshatriyas and women adorning saffron sarees gathered to hold a public meeting at the ground of Kedareshwar Mahadev Temple in Bardoli on Apr 28. Speaking at Surat’s Bardoli, Rajput Sankalan Samiti spokesperson, Karansinh Chavda said, “We are not going to let you (BJP) win, you have dishonoured our women, we will not spare those who come for our integrity.” The Kshatriya community unanimously decided to reach their respective polling booths at 7 a.m. on May 7 and cast their vote against BJP. Kshatriyas across south Gujarat including Bharuch and Vapi, showed up at Bardoli Mahasammelan. Chavda sarcastically thanked BJP leader Parshottam Rupala and said that because of his derogatory remark on the community ‘the whole clan has met in unison today’. “Our weapons are our votes now, not swords and spears,” Chavda added. Kshatriyas have decided to cut votes on 10 out of 25 seats of BJP in Gujarat.

While he has cited ill health as the reason for this latest disappearance, rumours are rife that he is preparing to join the Bharatiya Janata Party. Kumbhani, whose nomination was rejected over alleged discrepancies, first disappeared on Apr 26, after the BJP’s Mukesh Dalal was declared the winner for the Surat seat, unopposed, after other candidates withdrew. He went AWOL for two days, during which time the Congress suspended him for six years over allegations of anti-party activities, aka, colluding with the BJP. In the meantime, a video of him surfaced, in which he explained he was “forced to come back” due to the protests outside his house. He claimed that he had not been absconding, but had been in constant contact with the Movdi Mandal. “I talked with Babubhai Mangukiya and told my family that Congress is with us, and we need not fear,” he is heard saying in the video. Given that public sentiment–especially within the Congress and AAP cadres–has been decidedly against Kumbhani, police personnel have been deployed outside Kumbhani’s residence in Surat’s Sarthana area to prevent untoward incidents. Kumbhani, who had not been seen since Apr 26, returned home, accompanied by a police protection team on the night of May 1, and announced that he would address the press on May 2.

As per the complaint filed on May 18, Kapil Sahane, a biochemistry tutor at SMIMER (Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research) hospital & medical college, was approached by his friend and fellow tutor Hardik Patwa in August 2021. Patwa offered Sahane to invest in a project for his company to provide ambulance services to various hospitals and large companies and make hefty profits. He introduced his partners, Hemanth Parmar and Mayur Goswami. To further strengthen his alleged fraud, Patwa also presented an agreement with Maharashtra’s JSW Steel Ltd, which issued a tender for ambulance requirements and a deal of 12 ambulances being on the cards. He asked Sahane to come aboard this venture. Patwa also presented a bogus order signed by an authorised person of the company, mentioning an order for 8 out of the 12 ambulances by the company. An investment of ₹7 cr was required, and the company would pay ₹3.46 cr in return, as per the order. Convinced by Patwa’s pitch, Sahane spoke to his friends and conducted a meeting at the clinic of Dr Keyur Prajapati. Patwa presented the company’s service order and offered a 50% profit division between him and the rest of the investors. Over this, Sahane and his friends invested ₹5.24 cr between October 2021 and July 2022. Sahane faced a monetary requirement in August 2023 and asked Patwa for ₹25.70 lakh. However, despite promising to pay the amount in two months, Patwa stopped showing up to work and switched off his mobile phone. He had even locked his house and gone completely underground.

Fake currency printing office busted in Surat,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/fake-currency-printing-office-busted-in-surat,2024-05-23,23,05,2024,"Somewhere in the diamond city, a news weekly firm was busted with fake notes worth ₹9.36 lakh of ₹500 and ₹200 denominations on the evening of May 22. The Surat Special Operation Group (SOG) and Prevention of Crime Branch (PCB) raided the office of Surat Herald Weekly and SH News 24/7 channel, in Surat’s Limbayat and seized fake currency notes of ₹500 and ₹200 denominations totalling ₹9.36 lakhs, along with 3,110 sheets of paper used for printing the notes, a colour printer, two cutting machines, green ink pens, ink bottles, press ID cards of the news channel, and four interview microphones. The police nabbed 46-year-old Firoz Shah of Limbayat, who is the owner of a weekly newspaper and news channel , Babulal Kapasia (41) of Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, and Safiq Khan Ismail Khan (53) of Dewas, Madhya Pradesh. The interrogation revealed that Shah was advised by Kapasia and Khan to print fake notes to repay his debts. They promised to help him find customers and circulate the notes in Surat. With the help of YouTube videos, Shah learned how to print fake currency notes and bought the necessary equipment. He began to print fake currency notes at his news channel office two months ago. Kapasia and Khan were nabbed by the team of SOG-PCB when they were coming back with paper and ink from MP. The police have registered a case and are conducting further investigations. Shah used a ball pen with green ink to draw security threads on currency notes, making the notes look real. To avoid suspicion, Shah circulated the fake notes at small vegetable stalls and paan shops, using ₹500 notes for purchases of ₹50 to ₹100 and ₹200 notes for smaller items. The operation was a result of PCB and SOG monitoring the movement of Shah and his teammates for months. To reach him, the police conducted undercover surveillance for two months, posing as small vendors. Who is Firoz Shah? Firoz Shah was arrested in Dhanbad, Jharkhand, with ₹35,000 in counterfeit notes. He was released on bail by the High Court. After relocating to Limbayat, Surat, he initially worked as a land broker. Two years ago, he obtained a licence for money lending, which resulted in financial losses. Finally, six months ago, Shah started his news channel. He incurred a debt of ₹5 lakhs over medical expenses for himself and his daughter, leading to harassment by creditors. Later, he decided to pay the debt by printing fake currency, as suggested by Khan and Kapasia. Rajdeep Nakum, DCP, SOG Surat, said, “Firoz Shah after many efforts made bogus currency notes and sold ₹4 lakh of them to Sadiq alias Bataka Abbas Ali (resident of Umarwada) at the rate of ₹80,000. SOG is investigating the matter.” Also read: Maha cops nab 2 Gujarat men with fake currency notes of ₹50 lakh face value",surat

Raid and capture Based on information from locals, members of an ATS team disguised themselves as pastoralists and staked out the shed for 15 days. Then, following orders from ATS Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) S L Chaudhary, Inspectors S H Panara and V N Vaghela led a raid at the unit. They seized 31.409 kg of liquid mephedrone and raw materials worth a total of ₹51.409 crore, and nabbed Gajera – who traded chemicals in Surat – who quickly named his associates.

The trio has so far admitted to selling their product to a drug dealer in Mumbai, who the ATS has identified as one Salim Saiyed. A Palsana court has remanded the three accused to ATS custody until July 29. Nosy neighbours? The raid came after local residents alerted the authorities to the presence of the factory, which operated out of a tin shed “only from 11 pm and 4 am” and remained locked throughout the day. Neighbours grew suspicious when the mosquito menace was curtailed despite the monsoon, but were told the mysterious “factory” was producing “powder for mixing in grains and chemical tablets”. While the accused told the police that they have been operating for two-three months, locals say the shed—which the trio rented for ₹20,000 a month – has been guarded for the past seven to eight months.

They arrested 36-year-old stall owner Moinuddin Ansari, resident of Saiyedpura, and his two friends – fabric trader Mohammad Godil (38), resident of Rander Road and labourer Rasidjamal alias Banarasi Ansari (21), resident of Bharimata Road for allegedly selling drugs. The police seized 125.71 grams of MD drugs worth ₹12.57 lakh. The fabric trader sourced drugs from Mumbai and started selling them through his friend’s snack stall. The labourer’s friend would find customers for them, and the drugs were sold under the code word dawa (medicine). In addition to the drugs, the police also seized four mobile phones worth ₹75,000, a small electronic weighing scale, and 85 push-lock bags, totalling to valuables worth ₹13,32,200. Partners in crime During interrogation, it was revealed that Moinuddin runs a snack stall and a paan shop. Godil and Banarasi frequently visited the stall, and the three became friends. Among them, Godil and Banarasi were drug dealers. Due to a slowdown in his fabric business, Godil started bringing MD drugs from Mumbai for the past month, and the three of them began selling drugs at Moinuddin’s snack stall. Banarasi would find customers and Godil prepared packets after weighing the drugs. Banarasi and Moinuddin would meet the customers, verify them, and deliver the drugs in a nearby alley. To avoid suspicion, Godil and Mouinudduin used to communicate via phone and sell the drugs using the code word dawa. Lalgate police have registered a case and are conducting further investigations.

Ice cream and social media: The chilling scoop from ₹35 lakh drug bust in Surat,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ice-cream-and-social-media-the-chilling-scoop-from-rs-35-lakh-drug-bust-in-surat,2024-07-23,23,07,2024,"Vikas Ahir An ice cream vendor and two of his associates have been arrested for selling drugs in Surat’s Salabatpura area. The Special Operations Group (SOG) of Surat police raided the Grand Villa Hotel near Udhna Darwaja on July 21 following a tip-off about a drug smuggling operation. They arrested Chetan Sahu (22) and seized 345.910 g mephedrone, also called meow meow on the street, worth ₹35,49,100, two mobile phones, a car, and ₹11,350 cash, found in his possession. Sahu revealed the names of his associates Anishkhan alias Annu Lakdawala, Vikas Ahir, and Rehan Ansari to the police. He said that Ahir used the ice cream cart he operated in Surat’s Salabatpura as a front to sell the MD, which was ordered via social media platform Snapchat and Instagram from a seller identified as Javed in Rajasthan’s Pratapgarh. The drug ring also used other ice cream carts, ice cream parlours and even two-wheelers as points of sale. The SOG has arrested Lakdawala and Ahir, who are believed to have come in contact with Sahu via Instagram, while Ansari and Javed have been declared “wanted”. No strangers to crime Ahir, a known drug user and the leader of Hindu Yuva Vahini in Surat, was earlier arrested for a robbery at a builder's office in Amroli and his weapons licence was revoked. Lakdawala, whose criminal history includes a kidnapping and murder case in 2017, was arrested by Althan police with drugs just five months ago. He was released on bail two months ago. Ansari, the son of BJP Minority Front vice-president Jamil Ansari, also has a criminal record related to drugs. The primary investigation found that Ansari — who bought 5g MD from Sahu on the night of July 20 — had previously purchased 300g of the narcotic. Signs of deep rot? These arrests come a day after a bhajiya vendor was nabbed for selling MD in Surat on July 20. Less than a week prior, two engineers were among three held for running a manufacturing unit out of a tin shed on the outskirts of the city. This recent spate of drug busts reveals a disturbing trend. The diverse profiles of those arrested — from street vendors to engineers — and the wide array of legitimate businesses used as fronts for narcotics trade underscore the pervasive nature of the problem. Law enforcement officials face a complex challenge as they work to uproot this deeply entrenched network of illegal drug operations.

The outrage stemmed from the closing down of an English-medium school in the city’s Ambanagar area due to an alleged shortage of teachers. The committee, however, cited a lack of students as the reason. An opposition leader challenged this claim, arguing that this was not the case and expressed concern about other schools facing similar fate. The school in Ambanagar is listed as school number 357 on the committee’s website. However, opposition leader Rakesh Hirpara claims there is no school at the site, and it has shut operations. Hirpara claims he visited the school and added that “The Surat Education Committee has closed the school under the pretext of having no students, which is entirely false. Any school is established only after conducting a thorough survey of the surroundings. A survey was conducted before starting this school. However, the committee never assigned a permanent English teacher for this school. For about a year, the school functioned with just a single faculty, who belonged to the Hindi medium. This single teacher was solely acting as the teacher and principal, managing Classes 1 to 5.” Hirpara further questioned, “The school has been closed, but where will the children who studied there go now? The school catered to children of labourers and daily wage workers. Where are these underprivileged kids supposed to go now? Is this not mocking the poor?” He added, “As of July 31, 2023, the committee had only 36 permanent teachers for a total of 5,092 students studying in English-medium schools. These 36 teachers are not present all 365 days of the year, are they? What happens when some of these permanent teachers are on leave? The committee is not recruiting new teachers, which raises serious concerns about the future of the students.”",surat

The police action follows a raid at a privately owned godown on July 19. Acting on information that PDS grain was being rerouted to be sold on the black market, officials from the revenue and supply department raided the godown on Selamba–Panchpipri Road on the orders of the collector. They found 200 bags of grain of 5 quintals each, meant to reach economically weaker sections of society via ration shops, and a state-owned tempo used for transporting such grain. Officials seized both the vehicle and the 1,000 quintals of grain. They then took statements from the owner of the private godown, the manager of the Food Corporation of India godown (where the grain was meant to have been stored), and representatives from Arihant Agro Sales, which has a contract for direct-store delivery, among others. While officials are yet to name a “mastermind” behind this operation, the primary investigation has put Arihant Agro Sales — owned by Manish Shah — at the centre of the nexus. As a contractor for direct delivery in Narmada district’s Sagbara, Arihant Agro and its sub-contractors in Tapi, Valsad, Chhotaudepur and Gandhinagar had unfettered access to the grain. The owner of the tempo seized in the raid — one Anand Vasava — and the owner of a fair price shop in the region — one Jaykumar Vasava — both work for Shah. Another name that has emerged in the primary investigation is that of Naveenlal Shah, who officials believe is Shah’s partner in crime. As authorities continue their investigation, further revelations are expected in the coming days. Meanwhile, this case has shed light on potential vulnerabilities in Gujarat’s PDS, and underscores the ongoing challenges in ensuring that subsidised foodgrains reach their intended beneficiaries. The alleged involvement of a political figure and the apparent complexity of the operation have raised concerns about the scale of the fraud.",surat

The scam, purported to have been operating from Dubai, involved illegal transactions amounting to crores. Five persons, including two based in Dubai, are declared wanted in this case. According to Surat DSP (deputy superintendent of police) Hitesh Joysar, Olpad police received a tip-off about a duo, Bindesh Madadiya and Abhishek Chatrabhuj, who along with their accomplices, lured people into opening bank accounts by promising them commissions ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹1 lakh. Joysar added that the perpetrators collected account kits and sent them to Dubai. Using false identities on the internet, the perpetrators engaged in cybercrime and fraudulent activities. The duo, along with their associates, were supposed to converge on the Olpad-Sayan road to exchange account kits and essential documents. Acting on the tip-off, the police arrived at the location, arrested the perpetrators, and seized the goods. The police seized 27 mobile phones, 190 SIM cards of various companies, an Apple iPad, 11 bank account kits, 18 passbooks from different banks, 15 ATM and credit cards, Aadhaar cards, and a PAN card, which amounted to a total of ₹3,93,500. It was found in the probe that they opened bank accounts using the registered mobile numbers of unsuspecting individuals and then forwarded the documents to Dubai. Here, these accounts were used for transactions involving gaming, cryptocurrency, and US dollars. The account holders received meagre amounts in return, while full responsibility for any illegal activities was thrust on them. Police recovered account kits from the accused Milan and Vivek, who handed them over to Abhishek and subsequently to Bindesh, who sent them to Dubai. This scam, operating for the past six months, is believed to have involved transactions amounting to ₹51 crore–₹52 crore.

The decision to reverse this acquisition was communicated through a letter from the Chief Minister’s Office on February 29. The Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA) was instructed to remove the reservation on the land acquired for cottage industries. This decision was made during a board meeting of SUDA on March 13, just before the election code of conduct came into effect. SUDA’s board was directed to proceed with the necessary action to release the land, which was previously reserved for public use. This decision has caused a stir within the Surat civic administration. The government’s decision to release land acquired for small-scale industries, potentially diverting it for other uses, appears to undermine the Prime Minister’s initiative. By not supporting the growth of cottage industries, which could provide employment to many, the Gujarat government’s actions suggest a disconnect between its promises and its policies. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been advocating for the promotion of small and cottage industries through his ‘Vocal for Local’ campaign, the Gujarat government’s actions seem to contradict this message.

The department’s decision to award the contract to a different agency during the Tiranga Yatra than the one initially chosen has sparked furore among local residents. The controversy escalated when the department presented an incomplete proposal to the Standing Committee for the installation of LED fittings in street lights. The proposal’s shortcomings led the committee to defer decision-making to the commissioner and to review its legal aspects before proceeding. The retrofitting of street lights from conventional fittings to LED fittings and Centralised Control Monitoring System (CCMS) has been completed for Phase 1. However, Phase 2 remains unfinished due to a government agency’s unilateral suspension of work without consulting the municipality. The agency is now demanding ₹ 42 crore from the corporation. In response, the Streetlight department has proposed three options to the Standing Committee, including continuing with the existing Energy Saving System or adopting a new one. The committee has tasked the municipal commissioner to decide on the next course of action and provide a legal opinion on the existing contracts. The contract for this work is set to expire in December 2024, and it is uncertain whether the agencies will be able to handle the maintenance contract approved in December 2021. Discrepancies in the figures for Phase 2 fittings have also been noted, further complicating the situation. The proposal states that the agency E.E.S.L was tasked with installing 27,950 LED fittings in Phase 2, of which 14,739 were completed. The proposal suggests options for finishing the remaining 7,000 conventional fittings, but according to the department’s calculations, 13,211 fittings are still pending. This has led to accusations that the proposal misleadingly underrepresents the scope of work for 7,000 fittings, worsening the issues with the department’s operations.

However, no loss of life was reported in the incident. “Since the derailment occurred within the yard and the train was empty, no casualties have been reported. The incident involved the Udhna-Danapur train and occurred while the train was reversing. It caused several coaches to slip off the tracks. The repair work has already been started,” an official said. Heavy rains have battered Gujarat, leading to the cancellation and diversion of several trains, particularly in the Western Railway’s Vadodara Division. Meanwhile, the torrential downpours today created flood-like conditions in many parts of the state, severely impacting train services and daily life. “Dear all. I am on the Tejas Express 82901. I got on at Mumbai Central at 1545 and should have reached Ahmedabad Junction at 2215. Due to rain, the train has been cancelled at Vadodara - no official intimation. Just AC switched off. While rain has affected service, the Vande Bharat, which ran parallel to us, has reached Ahmedabad. We are left to our devices. Vadodara is flooded. There is nowhere to go. There are senior citizens and kids on this train. If the Vande Bharat can go from Vadodara to Ahmedabad, why can’t other trains? Not sure what's going to happen,” one of the commuters wrote on X. He added that no official has come to address the passengers, adding that they (railway officials) have just switched off the AC and left, ‘hoping we crawl out in suffocation’. “Some people have managed to open the auto-closing door so that we can breathe. Some passengers gheraoed some officers and they agreed to take us to Ahmedabad. I just hope we reach Ahmedabad. We hear reports of preferential treatment to Vande Bharat at the expense of other trains, but I saw it firsthand today. Posting this to let you know how the railways and IRCTC work,” he added. Numerous areas have been inundated, with knee-deep water disrupting traffic and affecting residents’ lives. The Ahmedabad Airport has also issued an advisory regarding the heavy rain forecast.

Despite the loan of ₹4.90 crore being approved, the funds were siphoned off from Navdiya’s account before the money could be disbursed to him. Navdiya’s ordeal began when he received a message demanding interest payments on a loan that had not even been processed. To his shock, he discovered his account had been frozen. Upon further inquiring, Navdiya found that unsigned cheques had been used to withdraw the funds. The funds were reportedly withdrawn by someone named Nimesh Patel, who was previously associated with the bank. From the sanctioned loan of ₹4.90 crore on May 15, 2024, ₹2.30 crore was withdrawn on May 13, ₹2 crore on May 14, and ₹58 lakh on May 15, totaling ₹4.88 crore. Remarkably, the loan sanction letter was dated May 15, yet ₹2.30 crore was withdrawn on May 13, well before the approval date. On August 13, 90 days after the account was listed as Non-Performing Asset (NPA), ₹5 crore was deposited into Navdiya’s account to prevent the account from being declared an NPA, funds were deposited just in time, coinciding with the Reserve Bank’s intervention and audit requirements. Following the same, Navdiya has filed a police complaint against Mehsana Urban Cooperative Bank’s Chairman K K Patel, Vice Chairman G K Patel, and all directors at the Surat Varachha police station, but is yet to receive a response.

Magistrate Thakar offered an unconditional apology to the apex court, citing her 14-year spotless career record. Taking this into consideration, her apology was accepted.

The Diamond City scored 194 out of 200 marks. Surat successfully reduced PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres or less) by a remarkable 12.71% in 2023-24. For this achievement, Surat will be honoured as a ‘National Clean Air City’ with a cash prize of ₹1.5 crore, a trophy, and a certificate at a ceremony organised by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change on Sept 7 in Jaipur under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). To improve air quality in Indian cities, the central government initiated the Swachh Vayu Sarvekshan to evaluate the efforts of non-attainment cities with a target of a 30% reduction in air particulates. The cities are mainly evaluated based on eight factors, including solid waste management, road dust, dust generated from construction and demolition waste, vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, public awareness programs, and improvements in air quality. Surat’s efforts to improve air quality Over the past five years, Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has undertaken several projects worth ₹5,000 crore to improve air quality. These include removing 4,200 metric tons of dust annually from roads using mechanical sweepers and reducing annual carbon dioxide emissions by 7,000 metric tons by using 35% e-vehicles for door-to-door garbage collection. In collaboration with the World Resources Institute, Surat has implemented clean construction guidelines in 280 ongoing projects to reduce the use of natural resources and manage construction and demolition waste.

The complaint highlights a potential double standard in enforcement of building regulations between citizens and authorities. A Surat resident, Sanjay Izhava, filed the complaint against the newly constructed police chowki at Gujarat Housing Board, Pandesara. The complaint alleges that the police chowki violates multiple building regulations: Constructed without proper approvals or permits Fails to maintain the required 3-meter distance from the road boundary Encroaches approximately 4 feet onto the footpath In a letter addressed to Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghvi, State Police DGP, Surat Police Commissioner, and Surat Municipal Corporation Commissioner,  Izhava asks why action is not taken against government officials responsible for such constructions. Izhava argues that the illegal construction by law enforcement authorities sends the wrong message to the public. He demands immediate demolition of the building and construction of a new office with legal approval, as well as legal action against officials responsible for the illegal construction. The complaint also raises broader issues of increasing traffic problems in Surat due to constructions built adjacent to roads without proper parking facilities. Surat Municipal Corporation's South Zone Executive Engineer SD Prajapati told Gujarat Samachar Digital that he had not received any complaint regarding the construction of this police post. He added that information on this issue would be gathered on Monday. This case has brought to light questions about equitable enforcement of building regulations, particularly when government bodies are involved.

Surat claims top spot in India’s air quality rankings,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/surat-gujarat-top-indias-air-quality-rankings,2024-09-08,8,09,2024,"Surat air quality index Surat has emerged as the leading city in India for air quality improvements, followed by Madhya Pradesh’s Jabalpur and Uttar Pradesh’s Agra. These three cities with population of more than one million, have topped the Swachh Vayu Survekshan (clean air survey) Awards for clean air, the government announced on September 7. Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav and Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma presented the awards to the best-performing cities where the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is being implemented. In the category for population between 300,000 and 1 million, Firozabad (Uttar Pradesh), Amravati (Maharashtra), and Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh) were recognised as the top three and for cities with fewer than 300,000 people, the toppers were Raebareli (Uttar Pradesh), Nalgonda (Telangana), and Nalagarh (Himachal Pradesh). Municipal commissioners of winning cities were awarded cash prizes, trophies, and certificates. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) reported that 51 cities have shown a reduction in PM10 levels by more than 20% compared to the base year 2017-18, with 21 of these cities achieving a reduction of over 40%. According to the NCAP assessment document, sectors given weightage include biomass and municipal solid waste burning, road dust, dust from construction and demolition waste, vehicular emissions and industrial emissions, among others. Experts have previously noted that NCAP does not focus on combustion sources and may not be effectively curbing toxic emissions. A Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) assessment released in July found that road dust mitigation has been the primary focus of NCAP, which was launched in 2019 as the first effort to set clean air targets for 131 polluted cities and reduce particulate pollution nationally. The assessment revealed that 64% of the total funds (₹10,566 crore) has been allocated to road paving, widening, pothole repair, water sprinkling, and mechanical sweepers. Only 14.51% of funding has been used for controlling biomass burning, 12.63% for reducing vehicular pollution and a mere 0.61% for controlling industrial pollution. “The primary focus of the funding is thus road dust mitigation,” the assessment said. NCAP aims to reduce particulate pollution by up to 40% by 2025-26 from the base year of 2019-20. It is India’s first performance-linked funding programme to improve air quality. Originally, NCAP was planned to tackle both PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in the 131 non-attainment cities. In practice, only PM10 concentration has been considered for performance assessment. PM2.5, the more harmful fraction largely emitted from combustion sources, has been neglected, according to CSE findings.

Following the stone-pelting incident in the night, police responded swiftly and caught the perpetrators. A large mob took to the streets thereafter, demanding strict punishment against the accused. However, communal tensions ensued between the two communities prevalent in the area. Regardless of the police presence there, stones were hurled by the rioters from apartments, leading to widespread anger. In retaliation for these acts, several vehicles were damaged by the protesting mob. Although the police managed to control the situation during the night, the angry mob was adamant about their demand for “bulldozers to be used against the rioters.” After the incident took place, Minister of State for Home Affairs Harsh Sanghavi visited the spot and ordered the police to take strict action. Following this, the rioters had been apprehended this morning. Thereafter, SMC began removing the encroachments of street vendors from the area as part of a follow-up action. However, several unruly elements aggressively opposed the civic body’s action. SC takes a hard line on ‘bulldozer justice’ Earlier this month, the Supreme Court mulled the formation of pan-India guidelines against the demolition of property of individuals accused of committing criminal offences. A bench headed by Justice B R Gavai stressed that even unauthorised construction has to be demolished in “accordance with the law,” and state authorities cannot resort to the demolition of the property of the accused as a punishment. The Bench, also comprising Justice K V Viswanathan, remarked that not only an accused but the house of a convict can also not meet such a fate, clarifying the apex court‘s intention to not protect unauthorised structures. Echoing similar views, Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, the second highest law officer of the Centre, stated that no immovable property should be demolished because the owner/occupant is alleged to have been involved in the commission of an offence.

Ranjit Buildcon remains Gujarat govt’s ‘favourite’ contractor despite controversies,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ranjit-buildcon-remains-gujarat-govts-favourite-contractor-despite-controversies,2024-09-10,10,09,2024,"Construction company Ranjit Buildcon is now at the centre of a ₹3 crore corruption scandal, adding to its growing list of controversies. The firm — known for its numerous government projects across Ahmedabad and the state — has been accused of embezzling mineral royalties from the Geology and Mining department during a railway track construction project in Kutch. The latest controversy came to light when Jawansinh Dabhi, a senior clerk in the Geology and Mining department, filed a complaint at the Anjar police station. Dabhi claims that the police initially refused to file the complaint against Ranjit Builcon’s representative Dipesh Sorathiya in May 2023 and tried to sweep [the issue] under the rug instead. According to the complaint, the scam allegedly involved forged royalty documents for about 7 lakh tonnes of sand and gravel used in the Samakhiali-Kidiyanagar railway track project. Ranjit Buildcon is accused of using fake stamps and signatures of the Geology and Mining department officials on a no-dues certificate submitted to the Ahmedabad Railway Division in 2021. No stranger to conflict This is hardly the first time Ranjit Builcon has been in the news for the wrong reasons. Just last month, a 135-tonne girder box and crane fell on a house in Surat’s Nana Varachha, where Metro work was being carried out. Twenty-four hours later, neither had the police filed a complaint against the contractor — Ranjit Buildcon — nor had the firm reached out to the affected family who had, luckily, been out of town when their home was accidentally demolished. The incident, which took place on August 22, came barely 10 days after the Gujarat High Court began hearing a writ petition seeking a stay on the Amdavad Municipal Corporation’s plans for a new flyover at Panjrapole crossroads. The civic body had recently awarded the ₹109 crore contract to Ranjit Construction, which is part of the same group. Court documents revealed that there was no actual need for a flyover in that area, or for decades’-old trees to be felled for its construction. The petition highlights the firm’s poor track record using two instances: A two-year-old was killed and several labourers injured during a road widening project between Jamnaba Park and Anuvrat Dwar in Surat. During Phase 2 of the Sabarmati Riverfront Project, the firm constructed an artificial sewage bridge that collected contaminated waste and obstructed the flow of river water. Notably, Ranjit Buildcon was also the only company willing to complete the Mumatpura flyover on Ahmedabad’s SP Ring Road, after a slab collapsed during construction, killing one. As the probe into Ranjit Buildcon’s alleged ₹3 crore scam unfolds, the case has drawn attention to the broader issues of contract allocation and project oversight in Gujarat’s construction sector. That a firm so often mired in controversy keeps winning tenders for government work raises serious questions about the company’s operations and its relationship with the Gujarat government. The persistence of these issues, coupled with the company’s continued success in securing government contracts, also highlights the urgent need for stronger oversight and accountability in public infrastructure projects. Ultimately, the Ranjit Buildcon saga underscores a critical challenge facing the state: balancing rapid development with ethical business practices and public interest.

Vips Group of Companies promised a 3% monthly return on investments and further enticed investors by organising international tours to destinations like Thailand, Dubai, and Singapore. Nine residents of Surat have fallen victim to the scam, and a complaint has been filed against seven individuals, including the company's director and agents, at the Umra police station. The case has been transferred to the Economic Offenses Cell, which has arrested one of the agents and secured remand until December 19 for further investigation. In a parallel investigation, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) discovered that the company had transferred Rs 125 crore abroad through hawala channels. The company allegedly collected funds under various schemes and sent the money to foreign accounts under the guise of forex trading. The firm had even set up a company named Kana Capital in Dubai for this purpose. On October 9, 2023, the ED raided the company, seizing significant sums, and registered a case in Pune regarding the hawala transactions. More details in this case are awaited. Meanwhile, in July 2024, Chinchwad police arrested a debt-ridden textile trader from Surat for allegedly facilitating cybercriminals by allowing them to park money from cyber scams in his bank account. The funds, siphoned from various victims, were funnelled through cryptocurrency and hawala channels to international masterminds operating out of Dubai. The scammers convinced the victims they were earning significant profits, with the app showing returns of over Rs 14 crore on their Rs 2.45 crore investment. However, the investors realised they had been defrauded when they could not withdraw any supposed profits. Investigators discovered that the trader's bank account was flagged in connection with 56 cybercrime cases across India, with transactions worth several crores processed over the past few months. Victims lost a combined ₹2.45 crore after being lured into investing in a fraudulent stock trading app by cybercriminals who misused the name of a reputable international brokerage firm.

Even though there is a dire health crisis, the department has not taken action, so the MLA wrote the letter to awaken the administration. MLA Kanani wrote, “I am writing to bring to your attention the severe outbreak of dengue and malaria in Surat city. Due to this crisis, the number of daily deaths is increasing alarmingly. Both government and private hospitals are overwhelmed with patients, and there is a severe shortage of blood in blood banks.” “Despite this dire situation, the Surat Municipal Corporation and its health department seem to be in a state of slumber. In areas affected by these diseases, there are no efforts to fumigate or spray disinfectants. There is no visible fieldwork in place to control these diseases. It appears that the municipal corporation is merely confined to their air-conditioned offices, engaging in paperwork,” added Kanani.

Advocate Hiren Naik, the applicant of this plea, was in a car with his friends, when Dindoli Police Inspector (PI) H J Solanki reportedly kicked him without any provocation and hurled abuses. The incident, which subsequently reached the Gujarat High Court, resulted in the officer fined ₹3 lakh by the court for assaulting an innocent individual without cause. PI Solanki also allegedly threatened the advocate with false charges under the NDPS (Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act. Advocate Naik, determined to pursue justice, tried to file a complaint at the nearest police station, but the police refused to register it. As a result, Naik approached the court to seek legal recourse. During the hearing, the complainant presented CCTV footage from the night of the incident, which was reviewed by the court. While delivering the judgment, the High Court criticised the PI’s actions, stating, “The officer must remember for life how costly an unjustified assault on an innocent person can be. Even if the individual had been an actual offender, it would not justify kicking them. This fine should be a reminder before raising a hand or foot against anyone.” The judge reprimanded the PI, stating, “Just because you have power, does that make you a hero? You can’t just assault someone without cause. Why has the government not taken action against such an officer?” The High Court also demanded a response from senior police officials, instructing them to provide clarification on what actions would be taken against the PI.

Officials say that the closest that Rai has come to having any connections with the Delhi airport is when he worked as a driver for an actual Customs officer there. The conman has been perpetrating his fraud in Surat’s Kamrej, Delhi Gate and Sagrampura areas, where he has been active for about 18 months. Prior to Surat, Rai was based in Goa, where he pulled a similar stunt — complete with uniform, an Army number plate and bogus papers that identified him as a senior inspector. According to persons involved in the arrest, the sub-inspector of the Crime Branch’s General Squad intercepted an Ertiga car with an army number plate from Varachha Bombay Market. The person inside, later identified as Rai, claimed to be a Customs official. He had a uniform bearing the insignia of the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBIC) and a bogus ID card of a senior inspector. The Crime Branch team also found an air gun, a driving order from the Central Board of Indirect Taxis and Customs and two mobile phones on Rai. The accused has now been handed over to the Athwalines police. The primary investigation has revealed that Rai had dreamt of joining the Army as a child. However, after two years at a college in New Delhi, he moved to Vadodara, where he pursued a Diploma in Aviation. Unable to find a job at the airport, Rai began working as a driver at a private firm. Chauffeuring the customs official allowed him to study his fare’s mannerisms in great detail. So, when the driving firm shut, Rai used what he had learnt from the official to pose as one himself. To that end, he created bogus CBIC certificates from Delhi and Goa, a bogus ID card and number plate, and gained access to a uniform, all of which he then used to defraud desperate jobseekers.",surat

The Station Master and the Railway Protection Force (RPF) were immediately informed, and repairs were swiftly carried out to prevent any disruption to train services, officials confirmed. This incident follows a series of similar attempts to sabotage train operations in recent times. On September 10, miscreants attempted to derail a train in Rajasthan’s Ajmer by placing two cement blocks, each weighing around 100 kg, on the railway tracks between Saradhana and Bhangarh. One of the blocks was hit by a goods train but fortunately, no major damage was sustained. Just a day earlier, on September 9, another sabotage attempt was reported when an LPG cylinder, along with a bottle of petrol and matchboxes, was found on the tracks near Kanpur, aimed at derailing the Bhiwani-Prayagraj Kalindi Express. The loco pilot was able to hit the emergency brakes to avert a major accident. Investigations at the scene further revealed disturbing evidence, including matchsticks, a petrol bottle, and a bag of gunpowder, indicating a more elaborate conspiracy. The country has witnessed multiple train derailment attempts in recent months. On August 27, four coaches derailed in the Udhna Railway Yard near Surat following heavy rains. Prior to this, on August 17, at least 20 coaches of the Sabarmati Express derailed near Kanpur Railway Station in Uttar Pradesh after the train struck a boulder, causing significant damage.

Three held for running food licencing fraud in Surat,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/fssai-food-licencing-fraud-surat,2024-10-01,1,10,2024,"FSSAI licence scam in Surat Two women posing as Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials, duped a local shopkeeper by taking money for a fake FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) licence. Police sources stated that the complaint was filed on September 30 by 35-year-old Pratik Boghara, a resident of Sarthana’s Yogi Chowk area in Surat, who owned a grocery store named Gurukrupa Sales in Shyamdham Chowk’s Shyamdham Society. The official complaint states that two women, dressed as SMC officials, visited his store on August 16, showed their fake identity card, and demanded an FSSAI licence from Pratik. As he did not have one, they offered to get it done for him and collected the necessary documents and a fee amount of ₹2,680. However, later, during a conversation with his acquaintances, Pratik suspected foul play by the two women and reckoned them to be imposters. Subsequently, he spotted them near a shop located in Pasodara and hence informed the police. Following this, the police swung into action and arrested the two women, Komal Parmar (25) and Shobhna Jalondhara (24). Their interrogation revealed that a lawyer named Rohangiri Goswami (37), operating an office in the Shubh Plaza shopping centre, located in Varachha’s Punagam area, had hired them to collect money for fake licences. Further investigation also revealed that although Rohangiri is a lawyer, he is currently not practising and had misled the two women into committing this fraud.",surat
Diwali in peril for local shopkeepers in Surat due to metro construction,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/diwali-in-peril-for-local-shopkeepers-in-surat-due-to-metro-construction,2024-10-03,3,10,2024,"Surat metro protests Shopkeepers situated on the stretch where metro construction is underway in Surat are expressing concerns that their Diwali business may be severely impacted this year as the project has dropped their sales. Metro station construction work near Maskati Hospital located in the city’s Zampa Bazaar area began in March 2023. As the main road has been closed for construction, local businesses have seen a significant drop in foot traffic and sales. Frustrated by the situation, the shopkeepers gathered at Surat Clock Tower Square today to protest, demanding, “Open the road or provide compensation.” The road closure, from Maskati Hospital to the Mahidharpura Post Office, has allegedly brought the area’s commercial activity to a standstill. According to reports, many businesses are struggling to survive. “Initially, compensation was provided, but now, even that has stopped, leaving us without income,” said one of the shopkeepers, echoing the concerns of many others. Placards and slogans were raised against Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC), alleging injustice with the businesspersons based on the stretch. The traders had raised their grievances with authorities, but the issues surrounding the construction of the compound wall and the lack of compensation have led to ongoing disputes. Local shopkeepers claim that when the construction started, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed, promising compensation for 10 months. When the project wasn’t completed on time, a second MoU for an additional 9 months was signed. However, after 19 months, only a partial compound wall has been built near the tower, leaving the other areas exposed. Additionally, the shopkeepers allege that instead of fully reopening the road, the metro authorities have only cleared a 3-metre-wide path, which isn’t sufficient for customers to access their stores. Moreover, compensation payments have reportedly been halted. “The metro authorities have betrayed us,” said a protester. “They promised to reopen the road in 10 months, but it’s been 19 months, and we are still waiting. As a result, businesses that have been around for 80-90 years are now on the brink of closure.” The shopkeepers are demanding either immediate road access or compensation until the road is fully reopened. There are also accusations that the metro construction has left several surrounding roads in disrepair, adding to the frustration of both residents and businesses.

Despite the grand opening and investment of over ₹3,400 crore, the bourse has not received the anticipated response, with many offices still unoccupied. To address this, the bourse committee has invited the LGDA for discussions aimed at the growing lab-grown diamond market into the bourse’s offices. Currently, only 50 to 60 offices are operational out of 250 offices in the bourse. Mumbai traders visit the bourse every 10-15 days, and around 40 traders have shown interest in opening their offices soon. Given the current recession in the natural diamond industry, the lab-grown diamond sector is gradually gaining market share. The upcoming meeting aims to facilitate lab-grown diamond trading within the bourse, potentially boosting activity and utilisation of the office at the bourse. The bourse committee is optimistic that this initiative will help in making the bourse a hub of diamond trade once again.

Police investigations revealed that over the past two days, more than 500 gem artists working for the company had protested by staying away from work, demanding the promised bonuses. The recession in the diamond industry has led to significant financial strain, with workers receiving only ₹15,000 to ₹20,000 per month in recent months, compared to their usual earnings of ₹50,000 to ₹60,000. The company’s refusal to grant bonuses further exacerbated the situation for many workers, including Singh. According to the family, Singh, unable to cope with the mounting financial burden, hung himself. Based on the family's complaint, the Varachha police have taken necessary actions and are investigating the matter. The diamond sector employs over 1.3 million people nationwide and is primarily centred in Gujarat’s Surat, home to over 800,000 workers. However, the industry is currently grappling with a sharp decline in activity, driven by global and domestic challenges that have severely impacted import and export operations over the past three years. One key factor contributing to the downturn is the disruption of rough diamond supplies to India, triggered by international conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the escalating situation in Israel. These conflicts have hampered the flow of raw materials, forcing many factories to close or drastically reduce working hours, leading to defaults and job losses.

The corporators, MLA, and even MPs are running from pillar to post to get as many recruits to fulfil their target. However, what appeared to be an internal objective of the party, has now reportedly reached the police force of the state, sources suggest. Law and order aside, police have reportedly registered 70,000 members for the BJP in seven days, following targets from the top. Rumours suggest that Surat city police have been employed in the drive, including membership targets. Sources also suggest that the force, despite being hesitant about it, has been successful in getting large numbers in small duration. The police reportedly achieved the targets given to them within a week, leaving the party members behind. The BJP’s membership recruitment drive has been facing a lot of backlash from the people as the workers are using various tactics to trick people into registering for the membership. In a bizarre turn of events, the former secretary of the Mehsana Congress was made a primary member of the BJP, as mentioned in a message received on his mobile phone regarding membership registration. Despite being in power, the party’s ambitious target of enrolling two crore new members has fallen far short of expectations. Faced with challenges, the situation on the ground has made it impossible for ministers, MLAs, and MPs to meet their membership enrolment targets. Numbers emerging from many constituencies indicate that the office bearers were not able to garner as many member registrations as the number of votes they received in the last election.

"GST scam worth ₹8,000 cr finds its roots in Surat",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gst-worth-rs-8-000-cr-finds-its-roots-in-surat,2024-10-28,28,10,2024,"A GST scam amounting to ₹8,000 crore has come to light, involving the creation of 246 shell companies by a resident of Surat to fraudulently claim input tax credits. This discovery was made during an investigation by the GST department in Pune. Ashraf Kalawadiya,who was already arrested by Police is now found to be orchestrating the GST scam, along with other accused, he opened 246 fake companies and orchestrated a massive ₹8,000 crore fraud. On Friday, officials from the DGGI (Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence) filed a complaint at the Koregaon Park police station in Pune, leading to the registration of an FIR. The main accused, Ashraf Kalawadiya (50), along with Nitin Barage, Faizal Mewalal, Nizamuddin Khan, Amit Singh (Ulhhasnagar), Rahul Baraiya, Kaushik Makwana, Jitendra Gohel, and others, have been charged under various sections of the IPC, including 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), and 120(B) (criminal conspiracy), as well as multiple sections of the IT Act. According to the FIR, in October 2023, the DGIGI team discovered suspicious transactions involving Pathan Enterprises, a company based on the Pune-Solapur Highway. During the investigation, investigators learned that the described company did not exist in the specified location or elsewhere. Further investigation revealed that a company was registered in Bhavnagar under the name of Pathan Khan. When the DGGI team questioned Khan, who turned out to be an auto rickshaw driver, was shocked and said he didn't know any company registered under his name. Which prompted the DGGI officials to conduct a detailed investigation into a specific mobile number and email address used to register these fake companies, including Pathan Enterprises. During this process, the investigating team identified a person named Jeet Kukdiya, who had an account at ICICI Bank in Rajkot. However, it was revealed that Kukdiya worked as a private security guard and had opened the account for the accused Kaushik Makwana and Jitendra Gohel. Kukdiya claimed he had never used that account. Based on information obtained during this investigation, raids were conducted in cities like Pune, Mumbai, Rajkot, and Bhavnagar. It was discovered that Kalawadiya, the main suspect and mastermind, was running Pathan Enterprises and other fraudulent businesses. Further investigations found that Barage was allegedly managing his illicit bank accounts and bogus firms in Mumbai, while Mewalal was apparently handling Kalawadiya’s financial transactions. Another accused, Nizamuddin Khan from Mumbai, was providing SIM cards and KYC details of individuals for opening bank accounts. Amit Singh allegedly played a role in setting up the fake companies, while Rahul Baraiya assisted in their sales, as stated in the FIR. Now the FIR against Kalawadiya has been registered as the mastermind of the scam and further probe is carried out in the same.

Sadhana Badgujar, the petitioner, is a mother of a 7-year-old child who cannot speak, walk, or feed himself and has a 96% physical disability. She lives in Satyanarayannagar in Vadod with her husband and two children, one of whom is severely disabled. The family purchased plots number 16 and 17 in Vadod and later paid the municipal tax bills, water connection charges, and had an electricity connection. About a year ago, the woman spent over ₹9 lakh to renovate the property, which has a current value of over ₹30 lakh. According to the petition, on October 1, 2024, SMC officials, including S D Prajapati, P B Bhoya, Chandresh Patadia, Fenil Mehta, and Mayur Patel, arrived at the woman’s home early in the morning. They forcibly evicted her and her children from the house, threw their belongings outside, and without any legal notice or prior warning, demolished the entire house using bulldozers. The family was left homeless and was forced to live on the streets. The petitioner informed the HC that she filed a police complaint and submitted representations to several authorities, including the Surat Collector, the municipal commissioner, the Lokpal, the State Home Minister, and the National Commission for Women (NCW), but did not receive any justice. As a result, she approached the high court. In her petition to the High Court, the woman has sought — -The restoration of her house to its original state at the cost of Surat Municipal Corporation. -Reconnection of electricity and water services. -Action against the responsible officials within two weeks, including criminal proceedings. -Compensation of ₹45 lakh from the guilty SMC officials for the harm caused to her family. It was argued in court that the woman along with her family went through a mental and physical toll due to the action by the civic officials. Justice Mauna Bhatt issued a notice to the Surat Municipal Commissioner, the executive engineer of the South Udhna Zone S D Prajapati, Deputy Engineer P B Bhoya, Assistant Engineer Chandresh Patadia, and others, seeking their response. Notably, the Supreme Court recently intervened in a similar case regarding illegal demolitions by the Uttar Pradesh government. The apex court had ordered all states and Union Territories to follow proper procedures for removing encroachments, especially when widening roads, and specifically prohibited demolishing properties without prior notice or compensation. The Supreme Court also directed the Uttar Pradesh government to pay ₹25 lakh as compensation to the victim whose house was demolished.

Two young women from Sikkim were killed when a fire broke out at M/s Gym Eleven and ALF Hair Beauty Lounge on the third floor of Shiv Puja Complex on Citylight Road late on Wednesday evening due to a short circuit. The city development department of the municipal corporation sent the report of the incident to the police on Friday morning.

According to the impact fee rules of 2011, the property was also legalised by paying ₹34 lakh and ₹24 lakh respectively. However, illegal rooms were constructed after BU permission. In August, the Surat Fire Brigade issued a notice for the lack of fire NOC in this mall, but to date, no fire permission has been obtained.

According to sources, there has been a rigorous effort to save Rungta in the matter due to his alleged political influence.

The move comes as part of the Gujarat government’s crackdown on teachers in the state who misuse their positions. According to officials in the Education Department at Gandhinagar, Sanjay Patel, Principal of Snehrashmi School No. 285 in Surat’s Amroli holds a residence visa from the UAE. He is believed to have travelled to Dubai 33 times for “business” without taking the appropriate permissions. The school is run by the Surat Nagar Primary Education Committee. Minister of State for Education, Praful Pansheriya, stated that Patel had used excuses such as illness to justify these trips and had abused his authority to evade scrutiny. Patel’s immediate suspension reflects the government’s commitment to addressing such violations, he stated. Pointing out that cases like that of Patel are the exception rather than the norm, Pansheriya said: ""Most teachers in Gujarat fulfil their responsibilities diligently. But there are a few bad apples, like Patel, who risk tarnishing everyone’s reputation."" He added that two teachers in Surat and nearby districts were recently found to be on extended unauthorized leave — one for six months, and one for three months — while engaging in business ventures abroad.

The elderly man was contacted by fraudsters posing as officials from the CBI, ED, and Mumbai Police. The scam began when the elderly man, Mohan, received a call from a person claiming to be from a courier company. The caller falsely informed him that a parcel containing 400 grams of MD drugs had been sent to him, and his bank account was being used for money laundering by Naresh Goyal from Jet Airways. The fraudster then threatened the elderly man with arrest and imprisonment, warning that both Mohan and his entire family would face legal action. The fraudsters continued calling Mohan, claiming they were from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and said that ₹2 crore in money laundering transactions had been made using his bank account. They told him that he would receive a ₹2 lakh commission but needed to share his personal information and property details to avoid being implicated in the case. Mohan was manipulated into paying ₹1.15 crore to avoid being falsely accused. The cybercriminals continued to harass him, and after 15 days, they sent a letter, claiming to be from the Supreme Court, demanding an additional ₹40 lakh. Unable to get the money, Mohan asked his relatives for help. His son, Mayur, became suspicious and questioned him, and realised the scam, and approached Cyber Crime police. The police conducted an investigation, gathered technical evidence, and traced the suspects.

Fingers are being pointed at BJP councillor Chirag Patel, who was allegedly present at the time of her death. But a week later, the mystery surrounding the suicide remains unsolved. As time passes, there are rumours that the authorities are trying to cover up the matter, causing growing rage among residents of the Kanta area. It is being discussed that two BJP councillors had convinced Dipika to make a large investment in land near the riverbank, which later turned out to be a fraud. There had been tensions between Dipika and the councillors. Rumors are circulating in the Kanta area that she had become disheartened upon realising that the money given to the councillors in the name of investment would not be refunded. What was the land deal? A few months ago, two BJP councillors decided to make millions of rupees overnight by investing in land along the riverbank, while the religious figures were preparing to purchase the land to build a temple on the riverbank. The BJP councillors, knowing that investing in this land would yield profits in a short period of time, were lured by the opportunity. So together with the devotees, the BJP councillors invested millions of rupees in the land. After initial large financial transactions, the devotees hesitated in paying the agreed sum. When the money got stuck, Dipika began demanding repayment from the councillors. Both councillors tried to avoid paying her, and there were ongoing disputes between the two parties.

According to the complaint, Himmat Vora and his friend Ravji Rupvatiya were searching for brides for their sons, Romit and Atul, respectively. Both fathers reportedly came in contact with Vipul Mehta, a matchmaker who claimed to have profiles of single women interested in marriage.
