"Cannot sell alcohol under the guise of ayurvedic syrup, says Gujarat HC",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/cannot-sell-alcohol-under-the-guise-of-ayurvedic-syrup-says-gujarat-hc,2024-04-21,21,04,2024,"In November last year, the Changodar police filed a complaint against Amod Bhave, owner of AMB Pharma, who was allegedly involved in manufacturing  toxic ayurvedic syrup that exceeded the permissible limit of alcohol content. Justice Hasmukh Suthar of the Gujarat High Court dismissed the petition filed by Bhave to quash prosecution against him for selling toxic ayurvedic syrup. “The state of Gujarat follows the ideals and principles of Mahatma Gandhi, has a firm resolve to eradicate alcohol, and has also amended the laws related to intoxicating drugs. The state has also made amendments to the Gujarat Prohibition Act to completely ban them,” said Justice Suthar. “In this case, the petitioner faced charges for selling alcohol under the guise of ayurvedic medicine and applied stickers to bottles that stated below the permissible limit of 11%,” said the Gujarat High Court. “However, the FSL reports revealed that alcoholic substances were more than 12% in the ayurvedic medicine,” HC added. The additional state prosecutor, Manan Mehta, argued, “FIR has been lodged against the petitioner at various places, including Dwarka, Kutch, Rajkot, and Amreli, for selling alcohol under the guise of ayurvedic syrup.” “By selling medicines containing alcohol beyond the permitted limit, he has played with the public’s health.” The Gujarat HC has dismissed the petition of Bhave, which demanded the quashing of the prosecution against him for selling ayurvedic syrup beyond permissible alcohol limits.

"Woman constable alleges misbehaviour by cops, HC orders report",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/woman-constable-alleges-misbehaviour-by-cops-hc-orders-report,2024-04-21,21,04,2024,"A petition has been filed by a lady head constable in the Gujarat High Court alleging Vadodara police cops of misbehaving with her and her male friend. The HC has ordered the state director general of police (DGP) and Vadodara police commissioner to submit a detailed report on the matter. The woman constable has made an allegation against top officials of her police department—Gorwa police station. “The state DGP and Vadodara police commissioner will have to submit a detailed report on Gorwa police station, including CCTV footage and other materials relating to the case of the petitioner,” said Justice Hasmukh Suthar. “If the woman constable was physically harassed during the night, it is a matter of disappointment,” added Suthar. As per the case details, a woman constable was harassed by the Vadodara police cops. The constable and her male friend were standing on a public road (under the jurisdiction of Gorwa police station) on the night of Apr 9 with a car without a number plate. A local LRD (Lok Rakshak Dal) jawan approached them and asked them ‘why there was no number plate on their vehicle’. The LRD jawan allegedly abused them and demanded ₹10,000. They were then taken to the police station, where the woman constable was put in lock-up without a court order and any crime. Her male friend’s clothes were allegedly removed, and was beaten up by the police. The police confiscated their phones and circulated some of their photos and videos among the staff. The petitioner has alleged that the police then made indecent demands on her. Vadodara DCP questioned The deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Panna Momaya, who was present during the hearing in the High Court, informed the court that an investigation was underway. However, the Court raised serious questions against DCP, saying, “How far is this kind of behaviour of your department’s male cops towards women cops justified?” “What do you want to say about this kind of irresponsible behaviour of the police officers?” The High Court had also seriously criticised the DCP for taking statements from the petitioner’s parents and child in this case. The Gujarat HC has scheduled the next hearing for May 1 and ordered top officials to submit a detailed report.

Vishwa’s father urged PI Zala to add Section 304 of the IPC (culpable homicide) against the car driver, Joseph. However, PI Zala allegedly ignored his plea and rudely refused to add the section to the case. The horrific accident involving physiotherapist Vishwa Shah took place near Keshavbaug in Shivranjani in Ahmedabad, where a car rammed into the woman’s scooter, dragging her for 30 metres.

Guj HC slaps ₹20 lakh fine on GPCB over neglect in Dwarka pollution case,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-hc-slaps-rupees-20-lakh-fine-on-gpcb-over-neglect-in-dwarka-pollution-case,2024-04-24,24,04,2024,"Guj HC The Gujarat High Court has slammed the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) for its laxity in handling a pollution case involving RSPL Ltd, a company that allegedly discharged hazardous effluent, causing widespread air, land, and water pollution in Kuranga village in Devbhumi Dwarka. The divisional bench, comprising Chief Justice Sunita Agrawal and Justice Anirudha P Mayee, imposed a fine of ₹20 lakh on GPCB for its “gross negligence” in its duty. The court also directed GPCB to pay this amount to the affected farmers as compensation for the loss of their land and crops, as well as for the mental harassment and legal expenses they incurred due to the pollution. The court also ordered the GPCB chairman to take action against the responsible officers involved in the case and initiate an inquiry against them. The court further directed that the amount of the fine should be recovered from the errant officers who have shown negligence. In addition, the court ordered a departmental inquiry against such errant officers. The High Court also ordered action against RSPL Ltd for such blatant violations of environmental laws. The court also directed GPCB to follow the audit report and recommendations of Dharmsinh Desai University (DDU), Nadiad, for making the land of the affected farmers cultivable again. Dwarka farmers’ plight reaches High Court Advocate Anshin Desai, appearing for the petitioner farmers, submitted that RSPL Ltd had set up a soda ash plant near the petitioners’ fields and land in their village. The company was allegedly discharging its hazardous and chemical-laden effluent and polluted water directly into the seacoast, 1 km away, and on the surrounding lands. A canal built for the disposal of effluent suffered damages and failed to be maintained. This caused all the polluted water to fill the surrounding fields and the land of the petitioners. This left their lands barren and unproductive. The petitioners have tried reaching the authorities, including GPCB, since 2016–17, demanding immediate and effective action, but the board has only issued notices and imposed token fines without taking any concrete action. The DDU and GPCB’s site inspection reports also clearly stated that the company’s hazardous effluent had caused very serious air, water, and soil pollution. GPCB’s argument in Dwarka pollution case GPCB defended itself by saying that it had taken action in the case, from issuing notices to the company to imposing fines and even issuing closure orders. The High Court, therefore, pinpointed a few questions to the GPCB: “Why did GPCB officials remain inactive for four long years despite repeated pleas from the petitioners and their cognizance of the situation? Why was no strict action taken at that time? Did you only wake up after the court’s intervention and directions over the petitioners approaching the High Court and their agricultural land becoming barren and destroyed? It clearly shows that the GPCB officials have shown gross negligence and indifference in their duty.” Also read: GPCB doesn’t bat an eye even after 4605 factories in Gujarat break environmental norms AMC discharges untreated sewage into Sabarmati, reveals GPCB report",ahmedabad

Kamath, who is currently playing in an international tournament in France, will be quizzed upon his return to the country, an official said. Kamath is also being seen as a potential flight risk, since he has been informed about the complaint. However, the crime branch has made adequate preparations to preempt any attempts by the accused to abscond while abroad, this person added. Personal enmity? Police say the complainant had been harassed by incessant calls from unknown numbers, all asking for “indecent services” for 20 days, when she found out that someone had taken one of her pictures from Instagram, and turned it into a poster with her phone number on it. She then went to the cops who, during a primary investigation, found CCTV footage from the three areas where the posters had been put up. One of the clips showed a young man on a scooter pasting the poster. When the complainant was shown the clip, she identified the suspect as Kamath. Officials say this CCTV footage is the strongest piece of evidence in the case. While personal enmity is currently being seen as the most likely motive in this case, the police are still investigating further, they add.",ahmedabad

The private bus operators challenged the single bench judgement restricting the entry of private buses in the city from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. A bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Aniruddha Mayee upheld the decision to restrict luxury buses to city limits during the day. The HC also rejected a 2004 notification that allowed private buses to operate and park on specific routes. The single bench judgement of the high court by Justice Vaibhav Nanavati held that there has been a surge in the number of vehicles in Ahmedabad for the last two decades, which has resulted in the rise of traffic and parking issues. The HC upheld the Ahmedabad police notification and clarified that for the safety of citizens, the decision to ban private buses from the city limits in the daytime is ‘legal and appropriate’. The public prosecutor, Utkarsh Sharma, strongly opposed the petition filed by the luxury bus operators challenging the verdict of a single judge and the public notification of the Ahmedabad city police commissioner. He argued that the interests of the luxury bus business cannot be put above the lives and safety of innocent citizens. Therefore, the High Court should dismiss the appeal of the petitioners.

Jaysukh Patel’s apology in the HC Appearing before the court, Oreva Group managing director Jaysukh Patel sought apology for not being able to respond to the court’s orders in a timely manner and assured the court of full compliance with its orders, “always”. The court, however, observed that the Morbi bridge collapse was not a mere accident or an act of God but a result of the company’s negligence and dereliction of duty. It pointed out that Oreva had taken over the maintenance and operation of the bridge despite knowing its dilapidated condition, and cannot be given a “benefit of doubt.” “You (Oreva Group) have played with public property. You have a moral and legal obligation to do more for the victims,” the court asserted. The next hearing on the matter will be held on May 19. Notably, Jaysukh Patel was granted bail from the Supreme Court on Mar 22. Previously, the court had put the Oreva Group on the dock by asking, “What happened to the trust that was asked to be formed to help the victims? What has the company done about the rehabilitation of the victim families, as it had promised three months ago? Why has the Oreva Group not filed an affidavit for three months?” Also read: Morbi bridge tragedy: SC grants conditional bail to Oreva Group’s Jaysukh Patel Guj HC serves contempt notice to Oreva Group in Morbi bridge collapse case Guj HC directs Oreva group to adopt Morbi village, look after victims’ kins",ahmedabad

The minister highlighted the party’s achievements and criticised the Congress party’s performance. “What does Congress have? They lack a leader, policy, and intent,” he remarked. In contrast, the defence minister cited data from the International Monetary Fund indicating a reduction in poverty rates under Modi’s leadership, with a promise to eradicate poverty within the next 5-10 years.

Addressing allegations against the Enforcement Directorate (ED), he assured the public of legal recourse, stating, “If ED has done anything wrong, you can always go to the courts.” He also recalled Mahatma Gandhi’s advice that the Congress should be disbanded, suggesting that the public is now inclined to see the Congress party’s influence wane. Looking forward, Singh announced that India is set to host the Olympics in 2036, as outlined in the BJP’s ‘Sankalp Patra’ - a pledge of the party.

Suggesting to fix the low amount of the penalty, HC said that those who violate rules have ample money, and they will continue to run the hospital by simply paying off the fine.

Between April 2023 and April 2024, these buses were involved in a whopping 353 accidents, which killed a total of 20 people. The fleet of red monoliths is officially under the aegis of the Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service (AMTS). However, as Gujarat Samachar reported in April, the service is now operated entirely by contractors. These include former BJP MLAs, corporators and other functionaries of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. For instance, as recently as May 12, the brakes on an AMTS bus failed near Jodhpur crossroads, causing the driver to lose control and ram into eight vehicles. While no casualties were reported this time, the outcome could have been catastrophic. Operator name Accidents Total deaths Aadinath Bulk 53 6 Arham Travels 64 5 Matheshwari Travels 25 1 Shree Maruti Travels 12 0 Shree Maruti Travels 41 1 Shree Maruti Travels 12 0 Tanak Bus Service 100 6 Laxmi Travels 1 0 Others 45 1 Finally waking up to the sorry state of affairs, transport authorities have topped the maximum speed for buses at 40 km per hour. Operators are now expected to submit fitness certificates for their buses every 15 days. And, bus operators will also be required to investigate whether the driver was drunk at the time of any accidents, according to a proposal for which is being placed before the AMTS committee meeting on May 14. It is strange enough that these “corrective measures” put the onus for safety on the same operators on whose watch the accidents occurred in the first place. Stranger still is the fact that none of these contractors have faced any punitive action for previous safety and maintenance issues.

Considering the gravity and sensitivity of the case, Justice Hasmukh Suthar has rejected the quashing petition of the three accused including father-in-law, mother-in-law, and son. Justice Suthar said, “In this case, along with Sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC), serious offences are involved under Sections 66E, 67, 67A (specifically deal with cybercrime related to pornography)” He also cited Section 77 (A)- where the court shall not compound any offence that affects the socio-economic conditions of the country or has been committed against women. The High Court condemned the accused’s criminal actions as an assault on the fundamental aspects of the woman’s life, her dignity, freedom, and integrity. It also directed the trial court to swiftly conduct the trial to ensure justice. The High Court also emphasised on the trial court’s responsibility to determine the case based on its merits. The petition filed by the accused stated an argument that the entire case had been resolved through family mediation, citing the complaint to be redundant. Moreover, a statement of consent of resolution was also issued from the wife (complainant). Opposing the quashing petition, Assistant Government Pleader (AGP) Manan Mehta stated that the allegations against the accused are very serious and extremely sensitive. He also mentioned that since the accused have been involved in serious crimes against society, the investigation in this case has been initiated. During the investigation, strong evidence against the accused has been obtained, and the charge sheet has been filed. What was the case? In August 2023, the Rajkot Cybercrime arrested three accused including the mother-in-law, father-in-law and husband of a woman for allegedly forcing her to record intimate videos with her husband. The complainant (survivor) also pointed out to her mother-in-law that her father-in-law had instigated her husband to record their intimate scenes on the phone and upload them on pornographic websites to earn money. The daughter-in-law also alleged that the accused in-laws also forced them to perform unnatural acts to record.

IPL 2024: RR end winless streak; to meet SRH for place in final,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/sports/ipl-2024-rr-end-winless-streak-to-meet-srh-for-place-in-final,2024-05-23,23,05,2024,"Rajasthan Royals went up and down in their chase of 173 but finally managed to end their five-match winless streak with a four-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL 2024 Eliminator at the Narendra Modi Stadium on May 22. With the result, RR have ended RCB's dream comeback run and six-game winning after being at the bottom of the points table to now set up a clash with Sunrisers Hyderabad in Qualifier 2 at Chennai. The winner of the Qualifier 2 clash at Chennai will face Kolkata Knight Riders in the final on Sunday. After Avesh Khan (3-44) and Ravichandran Ashwin (2-19) starred in a disciplined bowling effort to restrict RCB to 172/8, Yashasvi Jaiswal top-scored with 45, followed by Riyan Parag (36), Shimron Hetmyer (26) and Rovman Powell (16 not out) propelled RR to complete the chase in 19 overs. Chasing 173, Jaiswal survived on five when Cameron Green dropped a difficult chance at first slip. After that, Jaiswal hit three fours off the next four balls against Yash Dayal, before he and Tom Kohler-Cadmore took three boundaries collectively off Mohammed Siraj. Kohler-Cadmore earned a reprieve when Glenn Maxwell shelled a simple catch in the deep and went on to take two fours off Dayal. But the batter fell to Lockie Ferguson in the last over of Power-play when his off-stump was rattled by a slower yorker. Jaiswal and Sanju Samson collectively took three boundaries off Swapnil Singh, but the former fell when his attempt to scoop took a glove edge behind against Green. In the next over, Samson stepped out against Karn Sharma and missed a wide ball to be stumped easily. There was more cheer for RCB as Virat Kohli executed a superb throw from the deep after running to his left from deep square leg and had a casual Dhruv Jurel run-out. Hetmyer began to calm RR’s nerves with a six over wide long-on off Green before Parag hit a lovely inside-out six over cover and backed away to ramp a short ball over the third-man boundary for four more, as 17 runs came off the 16th over. Hetmyer drove and slashed Dayal for two fours, as the equation for RR became 19 off 18 balls. But Parag fell for 36 off 26 balls after he missed a big heave off Siraj and saw his middle stump being uprooted. Three balls later, Hetmyer went for a flick, but the leading edge was caught by cover running back and clinging on for a superb catch, as RCB brought a twist in the tale. With 13 runs needed off 12 balls, Powell toe-ended a square drive and edged in the third-man region to collect consecutive fours off Ferguson. Powell finished off the chase with a gentle loft down the ground to ensure RR have a shot at entering the final, while RCB were left heartbroken. Previously, on a red soil pitch, Trent Boult (1/16) built pressure with a tidy opening spell, before Ashwin bowled a delightful spell to ensure RCB weren’t let off the hook. Avesh then bounced back from giving 30 runs in his first two overs by conceding only 14 runs in his last two overs and taking three wickets as RR gave away just 47 runs in the last five overs. Electing to bowl first, Boult kept things tight when he found early swing and denied Kohli as well as du Plessis room to hit boundaries. Kohli began the early fightback by picking a four off Sandeep Sharma before du Plessis closed the second over by thumping a six down the ground. Kohli hooked Avesh for six before du Plessis scooped and smashed him for two fours. Boult was rewarded for his perseverance when du Plessis miscued to deep mid-wicket, where Powell dived forward to complete a superb low catch. Kohli slapped and whipped Sandeep for two boundaries in the last over of power-play, but his attempt to slog-sweep Yuzvendra Chahal through the short square boundary resulted in him picking out deep mid-wicket to perfection. Green muscled Chahal for six and four respectively, before Rajat Patidar was dropped on five by Jurel at long-on off Ashwin. The duo would take a four each off Avesh before Ashwin bounced back by removing the duo in the 13th over. While Green miscued off a carrom ball to a backtracking cover, Maxwell holed out to long-on to fall for a golden duck. Patidar broke the shackles by striking three quick boundaries, before miscuing one to mid-off against Avesh. Dinesh Karthik survived a contentious LBW call on review off Avesh but didn’t produce any heroics as he miscued a good short ball from the pacer to cover. Mahipal Lomror hit four boundaries in his 17-ball 32 before slicing to deep point to become Avesh’s third scalp of the match, followed by Karn slicing to sweeper cover on the last ball off Sandeep, as 172 wasn’t enough for RCB to continue their dream run. Brief scores: Royal Challengers Bengaluru 172/8 in 20 overs (Rajat Patidar 34, Virat Kohli 33; Avesh Khan 3-44, Ravichandran Ashwin 2-19) lost to Rajasthan Royals 174/6 in 19 overs (Yashasvi Jaiswal 45, Riyan Parag 36; Mohammed Siraj 2-33, Karn Sharma 1-19) by four wickets (This story was taken from a syndicated feed, and edited only for style by Gujarat Samachar Digital staff)",ahmedabad

This marks an important development in a prolonged legal battle that has spanned over two decades between the two - Patkar and Saxena, who was also the chairman of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC). The defamation case stems from a series of legal disputes that began in 2000. At that time, Patkar filed a suit against Saxena for publishing advertisements that she claimed were defamatory towards her and the NBA. Saxena was then the head of the Ahmedabad-based NGO, National Council for Civil Liberties. In response, Saxena filed two defamation cases against Patkar - one for alleged derogatory remarks she made about him during a television appearance, while the second case involved a press statement issued by Patkar. Metropolitan Magistrate Raghav Sharma of Saket Courts noted that Patkar made and published imputation that the complainant had visited Malegaon, praised NBA, had issued a cheque of ₹40,000, which came from Lal Bhai Group, and that “he was a coward and not a patriot”. Magistrate Sharma noted: “The accused by publishing the above imputation intended to harm or knew or had reason to believe that such imputation will harm complainant’s reputation.” Advocates Gajinder Kumar, Kiran Jai, Chandra Shekhar, Drishti, and Somya Arya appeared for the LG, while advocate Sridevi Pannikar represented Patkar in the court. Magistrate judge remarks in Medha Patkar conviction Regarding Patkar’s statements calling the LG a coward, and not a patriot, and alleging his involvement in hawala transactions, the judge said they were not only defamatory per se, but also crafted to incite negative perceptions. “Furthermore, the accusation that the complainant was mortgaging the people of Gujarat and their resources to foreign interests was a direct attack on his integrity and public service,” he said. “The complainant’s testimony, supported by the depositions of CW2 and CW3, demonstrated that the defamatory statements made by the accused not only questioned his integrity and patriotism, but also falsely associated him with activities contrary to his public stance,” he added. According to the judgement, Patkar failed to provide any evidence to counter these claims or to show that she did not intend or foresee the harm these imputations would cause. It was Magistrate Sharma’s findings that it is clear that Patkar’s actions were deliberate and malicious, aimed at tarnishing the complainant’s “good name”, and have indeed caused substantial harm to his standing and credit in the eyes of the public.

During today’s hearing, the High Court raised sharp questions and slammed the government and authorities saying that the court does ‘not trust the government and the authorities’.

The structure was not built under Section 253-269 of the GPMC Act, 1949 which states that “every person who shall intend to erect a building shall give to the Commissioner notice of his said intention in the form prescribed in the bye-laws and containing all such information as may be required to be furnished under the bye-laws”. Justice Biren Vaishnav remarked, “Honestly, we do not trust the state government now. After four years of passing orders this is the sixth incident that has happened.” “Are we to assume you turned a blind eye? What do you and your people do?” the court asked. The court also questioned the commissioner regarding this. The Additional Advocate General Mitesh Amin, replied the High Court saying that the government has taken immediate steps. All game zones in the state have been closed. The government is very serious about this incident and no one will be spared. He also added that six officials have been suspended. An FIR has been lodged against six accused and two have been arrested. During the hearing, the petitioner stated that no approval had been sought for the Rajkot TRP game zone. Many deaths, including those of children, have occurred as rules were not being followed. The petitioner claimed that the game zone was operating unlawfully, and despite warnings from the system and police, no action was taken. The Gujarat High Court concluded by criticising the lax attitude of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation and the lack of action for three years.

After the Gujarat High Court’s strict order on scrutinising of gaming zones in major cities, AMC Commissioner M Thennarasan held a meeting at the Riverfront House with officials from various departments, including estate and fire. Ahmedabad’s game zones were under scrutiny after the AMC’s meeting. The city is home to 28 indoor and 6 outdoor gaming zones, which are under scrutiny. It was revealed that the Gota-based Fungrito and JoyBox game zones in South Bopal lacked Building Usage (BU) permission while the Fun Campus near Nikol lacked a fire department non-objection certificate (NOC). Similarly, in Ahmedabad’s Jodhpur, a gaming zone has been operating without BU permissions. Moreover, the Joy and Joy gaming zone in Chandlodia also lacked fire NOC for building usage. FunZone near Aarohi Crest Road in Bopal lacked fire NOC for building usage.

Maximum punishment sought for Medha Patkar in case tied to Ahmedabad NGO,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/national/maximum-punishment-sought-for-medha-patkar-in-case-tied-to-ahmedabad-ngo,2024-05-30,30,05,2024,"Medha Patkar A Delhi court today adjourned the awarding of sentence to Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) activist Medha Patkar, who has been convicted in a defamation case filed by Delhi Lieutenant Governor (LG) VK Saxena, to June 7. On May 24, Metropolitan Magistrate Raghav Sharma of Saket Courts convicted Patkar in the case, marking an important development in a prolonged legal battle spanning over two decades between Patkar and Saxena, who was the head of the Ahmedabad-based NGO, National Council for Civil Liberties, when the legal disputes began in 2000. Saxena, the complainant, has submitted written arguments stressing the necessity of imposing the maximum sentence on Patkar. The submission cites several critical points to support his call for stringent punishment. Saxena’s arguments over maximum punishment Firstly, the ‘criminal history’ and ‘antecedents’ of Patkar have been brought to the court’s attention, showcasing a persistent defiance of the law that is a ‘characteristic of the accused’. This defiance is further evidenced by the admonishment of the NBA by the Supreme Court for false pleadings. The seriousness of the offence of defamation has also been stressed upon, equating it with ‘moral turpitude’. Such a ‘serious offence’, argues the complainant, demands stringent punishment, especially as there is no evidence that Patkar respects the law. Patkar is identified as a ‘habitual offender’ by the complainant, citing another defamation case from 2006 that is still pending adjudication before the court. The complainant also claimed that Patkar shows no concern for social control and defies ethical and moral justifications, aggravating circumstances that indicate her culpability based on her past conduct and criminal history. The submission concluded that a deterrent punishment is necessary, adding that the “maximum sentence should be imposed to deter Patkar and set an example in society, discouraging others from engaging in similar acts that hinder the country's development”. The defamation case stems from a series of legal disputes that began in 2000. At that time, Patkar filed a suit against Saxena for publishing advertisements that she claimed were defamatory towards her and the NBA. Cases against Medha Patkar In response, Saxena filed two defamation cases against Patkar - one for alleged derogatory remarks she made about him during a television appearance, while the second case involved a press statement issued by Patkar. While convicting her, the magistrate noted that Patkar made and published imputation that the complainant had visited Malegao, praised NBA, had issued a cheque of ₹40,000, which came from Lal Bhai Group, and that “he was a coward and not a patriot”. Magistrate Sharma noted: “The accused by publishing the above imputation intended to harm or knew or had reason to believe that such imputation will harm complainant’s reputation.” Passing the order for her conviction, Magistrate Sharma noted that reputation is one of the most valuable assets a person can possess, as it affects both personal and professional relationships, and can significantly impact an individual’s standing in society.

The 46-year-old suspect, Osman Pushparaja Gerard, was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Colombo, Sri Lanka police media spokesman said. After the arrests of four suspects by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) for having links with the banned outfit Islamic State, Sri Lanka launched a high-level investigation with the participation of two main intelligence branches of the police, the CID and the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) and other military intelligence services.

Sri Lanka Police had so far arrested six suspects, including the handler who was linked with the four arrested in India. Among those others arrested in Sri Lanka are: a suspect who had prepared a flag with an ISIS logo before which the suspects had taken an oath, two other oath takers who originally planned to go to India but later refused (making two newcomers to join the four arrested at Ahmedabad) and another suspect who handled the financial transactions. On May 19, the ATS had arrested four suspects who had arrived on an Indigo flight from Colombo to Chennai. Among the arrested individuals, Mohammed Nusrat, 35, who was involved in selling imported telecommunication devices and electrical equipment from Singapore, Malaysia, and Dubai had a criminal history. In September 2020 he had been arrested in Colombo for keeping heroin in his possession while the other suspect, 27-year-old Mohammad Nafran, had been running a business of importing clothing material and chocolates from India and Dubai. In 2017, Nafran was arrested by the Sri Lanka Police under the National Gem and Jewellery Authority Act. He was also the son of Mohamed Niyas Naufer alias 'Potta Naufer', a notorious underworld drug lord who was sentenced to death for the killing of a High Court judge in Colombo. The other two suspects are Mohammad Faris, 35, and Mohammad Rashdeen, 43, both from Colombo who had made their first visit to India.

GCAS goof-ups skyrocket students’ concerns,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gcas-goof-ups-skyrocket-students-concerns,2024-06-06,6,06,2024,"In a bid to streamline the admission process and facilitate access to higher education, the Gujarat government launched a common admission portal, named GCAS (Gujarat Common Admission Service). Though the initiative aims to simplify the admission procedure for undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) courses across 15 state universities, it seems to have raised further concerns among the applicants, than provide a streamlined experience to them. One prominent issue that has emerged is the absence of crucial details such as fees and available seats for each college listed on the portal. The students are required to submit their preferences for colleges in the order of their choice through the online portal. This preference submission window will remain open until June 10. Following this, a provisional admission allotment will be announced on June 12. While Gujarat Technological University (GTU) and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University are separately conducting the admission procedure, 11 universities will be opting for the GCAS portal and merit-based allotment. The Gujarat University (GU) and Sardar Patel University (SPU) are conducting online admissions where students are unable to rank their preferred colleges in the order of priority at the time of registration. The students will have no control on college preference and therefore, they may not secure admission to their desired colleges. Moreover, the demand for admission to Gujarat University remains high, with over 73,500 students vying for UG courses against a backdrop of more than 55,000 available seats. University babus not responding? “There are some drawbacks of the GCAS portal. I was unable to verify my mail ID and contact number even after inserting the OTP,” said a PG course aspirant at Gujarat University. “On informing the University that the technical support on the given helpline number is not answering the calls, they had nothing but vague solutions to offer,” she added. The aspirant also raised concerns about the file size which was kept too short for uploading documents on the portal. “We are even unable to upload the documents sometimes on the portal,” added the PG course aspirant. The students voiced for a better online as well as an offline support system for admission as it is not at all easy.

However, a case of deliberate lapse by the fire department in Ahmedabad has surfaced after one Ashadeep Maternity and Nursing Home, located near CTM Char Rasta in Ahmedabad, resumed operations overnight despite being sealed on May 31 over the absence of a fire NOC (no objection certificate). Fire safety officer Kamlesh Patel issued a fire NOC on June 2 after determining that all fire prevention, life safety, and fire protection measures, as well as fire safety equipment, were in place and functioning properly at the hospital. A fire NOC, granted after a mock drill of the fire safety of the premises, requires all personnel from the fire department. Now, serious allegations are being made as to when and how these procedures were carried out on sealed property. Questions are also being raised about how the fire safety officer managed to conduct an inspection and upload the mandatory photos and videos of the hospital on the official portal, despite the hospital being sealed. This has led to suspicions of foul play and a demand for a thorough investigation into the matter. This incident has raised eyebrows among the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials, who are baffled by the rampant practice of issuing fire NOCs without proper inspection or adherence to safety regulations. It is suspected that hefty bribes are being exchanged to renew fire NOCs, a practice that may pose a serious threat to public safety.",ahmedabad

It was revealed that the authorities averted the demolition of the game zone despite the notice for almost 11 months. The negligence and lapse in responsibilities were confessed  as the concerned town planning officer and chief fire officer were supposed to visit the spot and conduct a proper legal inspection. They were also obliged to take legal action as per the rules of the Fire Safety Act. According to the details submitted by the RMC officials in the high court, only a scrutiny fee of ₹100 was paid online on Apr 2, 2024. Despite asking for relevant documents, and plans as per GRUDA (The Gujarat Regularization of Unauthorised Development) Act, 2022, the authorities failed to submit fire NOC, building use or development permission, or structural stability certificate. Not even any documents regarding ownership of the land were presented. A special bench had been constituted by Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal comprising Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devani M Desai to hear the suo moto cognizance of Gujarat High Court and PIL filed by Advocate Amit Panchal regarding the Rajkot fire case. A significant hearing of the case was held today at 9:00 am by this special bench. What did the SIT yield? On the other hand, though the investigations by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) led by Subhash Trivedi have now been completed, many pieces of evidence remain pending to be collected by the committee. It has been reported that nearly half of the files for police approval in the investigation process have gone missing and have not been found yet. Additionally, the committee is still conducting searches for other documents and evidence. Moreover, as the remand duration of one of the owners of the game zone, Kiritsinh Jadeja has ended on June 5, he will be presented in the court today. Lower quality fire safety equipment? Reports suggest that the owners and partners of the game zone opted for cheaper, lower-quality devices for fire safety which failed during a fire, resulting in 27 deaths. As per sources, investigations have revealed a gradual increase in revenue since the establishment of the game zone in 2001, with extensive construction aimed at boosting revenue. However, the exact revenue remains undisclosed, with suspicions of tampered financial records and potential money laundering through online and cash transactions. Income tax investigations are also expected. Also read: “We do not trust state govt”, says Guj HC on Rajkot gaming zone tragedy Gujarat HC directs to close all game zones across the state",ahmedabad

The meeting led by the city mayor Pratibha Jain and standing committee chairperson Devang Dani was to make sure the Amdavadis do not suffer from waterlogging this time. As of June 6, a total of 63,735 cubic metres of catchpit have been cleared across the city’s seven zones. This cleanup work will be completed in three phases by mid-June, second round, and third round respectively, according to municipal authorities. There is a network of 3,600 kilometres of roads in the city, and a stormwater line network of 950 kilometres has been prepared for draining rainwater. Despite being in power in the municipal corporation for two decades, the BJP has not been able to build a stormwater line network for the disposal of rainwater, alleged the AMC Opposition. As per claims of Dani, the work of drainage and stormwater line of drainage and stormwater lines in the drainage and stormwater lines of 100 kilometres in length will be completed. Therefore, this year, rainwater can also be drained on the spot on top of places where there are water logging issues. What’s the plan? Each zone will have zonal control rooms which will work across the monsoon season to tackle the waterlogging. It will have technical supervisors and other staff on the spot with GPS coordinates, which can quickly drain rainwater. The staff will be given the task of draining rainwater with municipal corporation uniforms at 140 spots. After that, work will be done to prevent rainwater from entering the Chandrabhaga near Nava Vadaj and Godhavi in the city. Red, orange, yellow waterlogging spot lists During the rains, all wards in the city will be monitored with the help of 2,300 CCTVs in the main control room of the AMC. A list of waterlogging spots will be prepared according to the zone-wise and rainwater drainage conditions, with more waterlogging spots being identified as red zone and yellow zone for waterlogging. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has announced WhatsApp numbers for citizens to lodge complaints regarding rainwater in their respective areas during the monsoon. Zone Number Central 9726415846 East 9099063856 West 6359980916 North-West 9726416112 South-West 6359980913 North 9726415552 South 9099063239 Control Room 9978355303 However, areas including Bopal, Kathwada, and Ghuma will inevitably suffer waterlogging.

This system is expected to reduce the waiting period for people at traffic signals. Often, motorists have to wait longer at the traffic signals due to the pre-set time limit, despite less traffic on the other sides of the crossroads. To address this issue, Ahmedabad’s traffic signals will go the smart way. The ATCS will be integrated with artificial intelligence-enabled cameras, which will automatically increase the green signal time at locations where there is a longer queue of vehicles. Typically, this system works in such a way that if there are no vehicles within its 30-metre range, the signal will automatically turn off and the road will be cleared for another lane. Suppose the signal on one side of a four-way intersection has a heavier traffic density and a 90-second opening time, while the traffic on the other side is light, the system will automatically reduce the red light time to 60 seconds. It will take into account the traffic on all sides, thereby reducing the waiting time at the signal and allowing motorists to exit quickly.

The Gujarat High Court on June 18 extended the stay on the release ‘Maharaj’ which was scheduled to be released on the OTT platform on June 14. The petitioner council, represented by followers of Vaishnavite Pushtimargi sect, argued that the film should not be released because it will offend religious sensibilities and may disrupt the law and order situation in the state. They argued that the film had incorrectly portrayed a controversial historical judgment that ruled against the Vishnav sect’s Jadunathji Maharaj in 1862. The movie may hurt the sentiments of Pushtimarg followers in the state. They had argued that the then Supreme Court of Bombay’s British judges held anti-Hindu judgments at that time. The other side represented by Netflix and Yash Raj Films, the production companies behind the film, argued that the film should be allowed to be released as it takes a lot of time, effort and money to make a film. “The film has already suffered a huge loss by not being allowed to be released on June 14. There is no need for a Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) certificate to show the film on the OTT platform. “Moreover, the film does not fully present the controversial judgment, even if the court wants to see the film, we are ready. The film is about the case that was dismissed. Therefore, the High Court should now lift the stay against the release of the film,” said the defence.

Followers of the Vallabhacharya and Vaishnav community argued before the court on June 20 that the publisher should act ethically before producing or releasing the film, and if there is anything objectionable or controversial in it, the authorities have the power to stop such content. Giving the instance of MF Hussain, they said, “This is not a personal creation like a painting by MF Hussain, but a film based on a person and true events and it is defamatory. Artistic value cannot be greater than social value. The greatest impact and influence of film is seen in social life.” “If religious sentiments are hurt and people’s faith is undermined, the authorities can punish such publishers and stop such productions,” the community argued. They argued that the film should not be released as it will hurt people’s religious feelings and the publisher has a responsibility to act ethically. Citing Article 21, the followers argued that according to Article 21, they have liberty to live life with liberty and respect. The film, according to its makers, is based on books, trials, and legal cases. “We do not say that Jadunath Maharaj was great, but all the Maharajas cannot be portrayed or presented as bad. The verdict in the Maharaj defamation case is defamatory,” they argued. “No work should glamorise objectionable elements.

Two perpetrators have been nabbed in this case, whose ties extend to Canada and Pakistan. The racket was unearthed following a complaint filed by Maharashtra resident Nilesh Sawant, who alleged that a betting website named ‘Magic Win’, among other similar sites, was illegally streaming cricket and other sports matches, officially broadcasted on Star India Pvt Ltd’s sports channel. The cybercrime team conducted a technical investigation and tracked the illicit server. Following this, the cops apprehended one Divyanshu Patel from Mehsana’s Unjha. On questioning him, Divyanshu revealed that he had pursued an IT engineering course in Mehsana and learned web development. This allowed him to create and manage illegal streaming operations. Extensive modus operandi of the perpetrators Divyanshu is responsible for developing and managing the illegal streaming operation. He provided his friend Shubham Patel, residing in Canada, with the necessary software and expertise to conduct live streaming on various websites. In 2020, upon Shubham’s suggestion, Divyanshu purchased two domains that were used to upload illegally streamed videos from other websites onto their server. During the raid at Divyanshu’s residence, the police seized three CPUs, a monitor, a router, foreign bank debit cards, and mobile phones. Meanwhile, Shubham procured illegal streaming links and codes from a Pakistani named Azhar Amin and offered him hefty payments. Police sources stated that Azhar and Shubham had met in Dubai. Azhar, with his expertise in satellite TV and technical connections, provided live streaming of various matches. Shubham had connections with several betting clients in Dubai and was responsible for negotiating deals. Divyanshu uploaded the content on the server based on the link codes provided by Azhar. More heads identified in illegal streaming-betting scam As per the cybercrime Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Hardik Makadia, it was also revealed that another person named Harsh Patel, also from Unjha, was involved in the financial transactions of this case. Harsh maintained contact with Azhar via WhatsApp and had opened bogus bank accounts to facilitate the illegal money transfers. However, Harsh managed to evade police arrest and is suspected to have fled to Dubai, sources said.

Also, there was no list of confirmed students. The GCAS portal is sluggish and disoriented,” said a Postgraduate (PG) course applicant. The GCAS portal lacks facilities for category-wise entry data, merit-seat matrix, choice filling, subject choice preference etc. The Gujarat government had given the programming work to Guj Info Petro Limited (GIPL) instead of the National Informatics Centre (NIC). Due to the non-availability of merit allocation in the GCAS portal, Gujarat University had to take the help of the central government’s Samarth portal. The first round of GU’s UG courses was completed on June 25, with goof-ups in category-wise, college-wise and course-wise seats. However, the second round of admissions is yet to be decided.

Teachers who are not subject experts are checking the papers. Teachers who are not proficient in the language of the medium (English or Gujarati) are checking the answer sheets in that language. The aim of the teachers is to maximise their earnings by checking as many papers as possible, to earn ₹8 for each paper checked, as per allegations. The student leaders alleged that even though the students had  written baseless things, the teachers had assigned them good marks. As per the rules, for undergraduate programmes, a teacher with 5 years of experience can evaluate answer sheets for the first year, a teacher with 5-10 years of experience can evaluate for the second year and a teacher with more than 10 years of experience can evaluate for the third year.

Get out of here.” The complaint adds that the seniors don’t even allow them to sit in the OPD (outpatient department—a consultation department). In addition, they extort ₹1,500 to ₹2,000 for snacks in the OPD on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and ₹2,000 to ₹3,000 for breakfast and dinner on emergency days. The PG student has written to the NMC requesting help in taking a ‘seat leave,’ as there is a ₹25 lakh bond for leaving the seat ahead of their academic tenure. The complaint from the student reads, “I am being forced to take ‘seat leave’ and I have not attended college for a year because of mental and physical torture.” The two students, including the complainant, have currently ceased attending college.

Ellis Bridge spans 433.41 metres in length, with a width of 6.25 metres and consists of 14 spans of bow-string steel structure. Once the repair work is complete, the bridge will be reopened for commuters. During the repair process, structural design methodologies will be employed, ensuring the preservation of the bridge’s architectural integrity. This initiative aims to enhance the bridge’s structural strength and historical value, providing a safe passage for commuters and preserving its heritage for future generations.

Either you do not understand what we are trying to say or the AMC does not want to do the job responsibly,” said the bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Pranav Trivedi. “AMC works 3-4 days before the court’s date of submitting the affidavit, it seems they don’t want to clean Sabarmati River. We are doing the job which the corporation should do. Your incorrect numbers prove that you are not sincere enough,” rebuked the HC. The Gujarat High Court also demanded a report from the AMC commissioner regarding the Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) and task force inspection. The Gujarat HC expressed its disappointment after Court Assistant Hemang Shah pointed out contradictions between the Gujarat Pollution Control Board’s (GPCB) report and the AMC’s affidavit. In the AMC’s affidavit, it said that each of the city’s STP was functional 100% whereas the GPCB report states the deteriorated condition of the Vasna and Pirana STP plants. The report also noted that most of the norms are not being followed by the STPs, and sewage water is being bypassed directly into the Sabarmati River. Sewage water The court asked the AMC officials how they plan to stop the bypass of untreated water from the STP. The court further stated that if the bypass is stopped, it would expose the poor condition of the STP. “Streets of Ahmedabad will be flooded with sewage water one day,” warned the HC. The court further questioned the silence of the AMC officials on the matter and asked them to stop misleading the court, accept their mistake and take steps to rectify it. Dead fishes in Sabarmati River During the hearing, Shah drew the court’s attention to a crucial issue that the water of the Sabarmati River has become polluted. “It is not being cleaned or maintained properly. Due to this countless fish are dying in the river. The AMC authorities are trying to save the fish by releasing oxygen through oxygen tanks at five to seven places in the river, but it is like a ventilator. The Sabarmati River is so big and long, how much will five oxygen tanks work in it? Purity and cleanliness of Sabarmati River is important and this work will be possible only through phase-wise work,” said the court assistant. The High Court also made critical remarks to the AMC regarding the waterlogging in the city during the recent rains. The court said, “You are not able to properly maintain your STPs nor are you able to maintain proper infrastructure or management in the city. The city gets flooded with water even after one day of rain. You should still show seriousness and do result-oriented work.” Also read: AMC discharges untreated sewage into Sabarmati, reveals GPCB report",ahmedabad

As per the General Development Control Regulation (GDCR), the length of the road should be 300m and width 9m, which has now been reduced to 5.25m. After the allotment of the ₹109 crore work order, now the Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner M Thennarasan and Standing Committee Chairperson Devang Dani have ordered a probe to find out if GDCR norms were followed in the construction of the bridge. The work order of the bridge has been given to Ranjit Construction. The four-lane flyover on Panjrapol was approved by the Standing Committee on March 7, 2024. However, as the road narrows from 15m to 5m, the traffic situation is expected to become chaotic. “When constructing a bridge, GDCR norms are not followed, but IRC (Indian Road Congress) designs and planning are followed. Whether the service road will shrink due to the construction of a flyover at Panjarapol junction can only be said after the discussion,” said the AMC commissioner. Dani said that if the service roads under the bridge are narrowed, GDCR norms will be referred to for a solution. Road Committee Chairperson Jayesh Patel said that GDCR norms shouldn’t be followed in bridge construction. Patel said that a 5m service road would be constructed under the flyover which will allow a heavy truck to pass through it. City Engineer Harpalsinh Zala said that the Panjrapol junction flyover’s design and planning are appropriate.

Political circles are abuzz with talk that the names included in the police complaints after the incident were based on a backroom deal between the BJP city leaders and the city Congress. It appears that guilty leaders from both parties made innocent workers scapegoats, leading to internal turmoil within both factions. CCTV footage of the incident clearly shows the involvement of both BJP and Congress leaders along with the workers in the stone-pelting. Meanwhile, to boost the morale of Congress workers, Rahul Gandhi visited Ahmedabad. At the time there were murmurs that Congress leaders had close ties with the BJP, casting a shadow over Gandhi’s sincere efforts to infuse energy into the cadres. . After a special NIA (National Investigation Agency) court chargesheet, it has emerged that Congress leader Shailesh Parmar had purportedly sent a video of the stone-pelting incident to BJP’s city president and MLA Amit P Shah. The video allegedly showed Shah’s son being part of the violent mob. In a game of political back-scratching, the video was allegedly sent with the intention that the BJP does not name Congress leaders in their complaint. A BJP leader expressed his displeasure in an X post: “Congress MLAs pelted stones at BJP workers who were peacefully protesting. This act exposes the cruel mindset of Congress.” Notably, a BJP worker who was injured in the stone-pelting is in critical condition at Ahmedabad’s SVP Hospital. While this has caused discontent among BJP workers towards Shah’s political ‘friendship’  with the Congress, workers of the grand old party are also unhappy with Shailesh Parmar’s shoot-and-scoot tactics. Reportedly, the entire matter has reached Rahul Gandhi and other top leaders of the party. Also read: Cong office in Ahmedabad vandalised, Amit Chavda accuses ‘Shah and Modi’s goons’",ahmedabad

All these mobile phones were used to book bets through various mobile applications for cricket betting, and a live match was played on a betting website on the laptop. The police found a balance sheet of ₹18 crore, with an available balance of ₹1.39 crore in a mobile phone. Another mobile phone’s betting ID had a balance of ₹50 lakh with an available balance of ₹15 lakh. This ID was sold to a man named Kapil Balotara for ₹30 lakh. Moreover, two other IDs with balances of ₹25 lakh and ₹30 lakh were also found. A total of IDs with balances amounting to ₹21.30 crore were found, which were used for large-scale daily betting. The police found a Porsche car worth ₹1.50 crore, which was revealed to have been purchased through betting money, according to initial investigation. The police also seized a list of financial transactions related to betting, conducted through angadia firms. The CID Crime Branch has registered a case against Praveen Jain and eight other bookies involved with him and has started further investigation.

Fire in AC at Ahmedabad’s Shanti Asiatic School; attempt to pass it off as mock drill,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/fire-in-ac-at-ahmedabads-shanti-asiatic-school-attempt-to-pass-it-off-as-mock-drill,2024-07-12,12,07,2024,"Parents’ protest at school Even as people of Gujarat are still trying to get over the child safety concerns raised by Vadodara’s Harni boat incident and Rajkot fire tragedy, it has come to light that an alleged attempt was made at Shanti Asiatic School, a high-end school in Shela, Ahmedabad, to pass off a fire incident as a mock drill. When parents of students came to know of the incident, they rushed to the school and protested over the lack of safety standards at the school. According to the parents, after smoke started emanating from the AC of a classroom, there was panic among the students, after which they were shifted to the assembly hall. The incident took place on the second floor and basement of the school on July 11, and the spots which had turned black due to the fire have been painted, the parents have alleged. An emergency exit board has also come up after this incident. The parents have accused the school management of trying to pass off the entire incident as a mock drill. They allege that they were not informed about any such mock drill. “They are saying that there were only sparks. If that was the case, there would not have been so much smoke. The school management should not only think about their business, but also the safety of the children. We do not send our children to your school to die,” an irate parent alleged, accusing the teachers of lying.",ahmedabad

FRCs in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Vadodara, and Surat were formed under the Gujarat Self-Financed Schools (Fee Regulation) Act, 2017 by the education department to get the traction in Lok Sabha elections of 2017. The FRC consists of a zonal chairperson and other four members including a chartered accountant (CA), civil engineer, and school representative. The chairman and other members of the committee are appointed by the government for three years. FRC ensures that no self-financed school should collect any fee over the fee fixed by the FRC for admission of students to any standard or course offered by the school. The committee is responsible for setting fees for all private schools in Gujarat, including those affiliated with the Gujarat Board, the CBSE, and other boards. Ahmedabad is the biggest zone as it has the maximum number of schools as compared to other districts. This zone includes Ahmedabad city, rural, Gandhinagar, Patan, Sabarkantha, Banaskantha, Arvalli, Kutch, and Mehsana. The position of committee judge has been vacant in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Vadodara, and even Surat. The government is processing the appointment of a chairperson-judge in all committees, however, the position still awaits an appointment. Despite the government’s implementation of an Act intended to regulate school fees, many schools have yet to finalise their fees for the 2024-25 academic year.

UK envoy Christina Scott places special value on Gujarat-UK ties during visit to Ahmedabad,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/uk-envoy-christina-scott-highlights-gujarat-uk-ties-in-visit-to-ahmedabad,2024-07-13,13,07,2024,"Gujarat’s strong ties with the United Kingdom, how the UK can support in the state’s bid to host the Olympics and economic relations between the two countries figured in the exclusive conversation Deputy High Commissioner of the UK in India Christina Scott had with Gujarat Samachar . Scott was on a visit to Ahmedabad on July 12. Scott talked about the bilateral relations between the UK and Gujarat, the ongoing foreign trade agreement negotiations between the two countries, and the future of these relations under the new Labour Party government in the UK. Strengthening relations between India and the UK is a top priority for the new Labour government, according to Scott. “It’s only been a few days since the new government was formed, but as far as the relationship between the two countries is concerned, it is our top priority,” said Scott. “We aim to boost not only people-to-people ties but also cultural and economic development, address internal and global security, and tackle climate change. Our Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs David Lammy has clearly stated that he will visit India within the first month of taking office. The Labour Party has also announced its commitment to strengthening relations between the two countries,” she added. UK-Gujarat ties The UK is the only country which has its permanent diplomatic office in Ahmedabad. Regarding the relationship with Gujarat, Scott mentioned that there are strong personal connections between the state and the country. “A third of Indians in the UK come from Gujarat. Gujarat is an economic powerhouse, and representatives from the state play a significant role in India. Students and businesspersons frequently travel back and forth. There are numerous opportunities for British companies in Gujarat; investments have been made, and now GIFT City is also important for us,” she stated. Educational tie-ups According to Scott, the Indians make the largest number of international students in the UK. “We love having them,” she exclaimed. “There are ongoing discussions to avail education of top British universities in India. Efforts are also going on for students from Gujarat to visit the UK for education,” she said. “Although these discussions are currently in the preliminary stages, the idea is to have campuses of UK universities in India where students, scientists, and engineers can study and also collaborate in research fields,” said Scott. Olympics– a bid for comprehensive development As India is aspiring to host the Olympics 2036 in Ahmedabad, Scott said, “The Olympics were a significant experience for us in East London in 2012 and a matter of pride as well. Fifteen years ago, East London was a relatively underdeveloped or poor area.” “After organising the event and utilising the facilities established for it, which are still in use today, the area has seen comprehensive development. The development continues to progress in that region as well. We can share this experience and understanding with Gujarat. It is essential that the Olympics are not just about organising a sports festival but also about achieving comprehensive development,” she stated. Gujarat-UK shared sectors Talking about the scope of potential industries in Gujarat, Scott said, “I think some of the strongest sectors for British companies in Gujarat are chemicals and manufacturing. We see increased investment in those areas. Over the last few years, we’ve seen a lot more interest in GIFT City. We’ve seen a large number of British financial services companies coming up and trading here and increasing their footprint in GIFT city.” Scott mentioned that cybersecurity is one area where the UK has big strengths, but also Gujarat has its strengths. Scott also expressed her fascination for stepwells and today, she visited the UNESCO World Heritage site in Champaner, according to her X account. Scott was also all praise for the vegetarian Gujarati thali and food of the state. Also read: Post Covid, over 2.5 lakh Indian students went to study in Australia",ahmedabad
Why no anti-superstition laws in Gujarat? HC asks state,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/why-no-anti-superstition-laws-in-gujarat-hc-asks-state,2024-07-13,13,07,2024,"The Gujarat High Court issued a notice to the state government and other concerned parties, including the Additional Chief Secretary of the state's home department, in a public interest litigation (PIL) while hearing demanding a special law to combat the menace of superstition and black magic in Gujarat. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Pranav Trivedi asked for a response from the government on this matter and has scheduled further hearings for the coming days. It was highlighted in the PIL that there has been a significant rise in incidents of superstition and black magic in Gujarat, and there are no legal provisions to identify or curb these practices. Other states like Maharashtra, Bihar, Karnataka, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Assam have anti-superstition laws, but Gujarat is yet to enact such laws. To ensure the safety and trust of the people, it is necessary to implement such a law in Gujarat. The petitioner also cited several sensitive cases related to superstition and black magic. The petitioner argued that people from backward and tribal communities are more often victims of superstition, black magic, and similar practices, but people from other sections of society are also affected in various ways. In Maharashtra, the Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice, other Inhuman, Evil, Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act was enacted. This law was promulgated through an ordinance just four days after the murder of Narendra Dabholkar, the founder of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, and later passed by the legislature.

Acting on a tip-off received by Police Inspector (PI) P H Makwana, the police raided an office at Maruti Plaza near Vijay Park crossroads in Krishnanagar, Ahmedabad. Cyber fraud through crypto During the raid, 13 people were nabbed and interrogated by police, which revealed the details of a complex cyber fraud. The accused, Dilip Jagani of Nikol and Dipak Radadiya of Hirawadi would open bank accounts of people by threatening them or by offering them high returns in stock markets. They would pass on the details of the bank accounts to another accused named Ketan Patel of Gandhinagar. The bank details were sent to Chinese associates, who would deposit illicit funds into those accounts. Jagani and Radadiya would then withdraw the money through ‘self’ cheques, and the money would be channelled to Darsheel Shah. Shah would turn the money into cryptocurrency and transfer it back to the Chinese associates. The initial investigation revealed that Jagani and Radadiya were receiving a 3% cut of the money converted to cryptocurrency. Police have seized 30 passbooks, 39 chequebooks, 59 ATM cards, forms for opening bank accounts, and accounting ledgers from the site.

During the hearing of Public Interest Litigation (PIL), the bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Pranav Trivedi said that incidents like the one in Ghatkopar, Mumbai, where 14 people died due to a hoarding collapse should not happen in Gujarat. The High Court also directed the Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner to inspect around 2,000 hoardings, banners, and billboards in the city and submit a detailed stability report of these hoardings and billboards. The HC further directed that the inspection work should be carried out under the supervision of the Municipal Commissioner, creating teams. In three weeks, the estate officer will have to submit an affidavit regarding the entire inspection. During the hearing, the government argued that as per the petitioner, there are around 100 such illegal and dangerous hoardings in the city. If the petitioner were to give a list of these hoardings to the court, then they can be removed. The state also argued that AMC regularly checks the structural stability of hoardings and banners and there are no illegal hoardings in the city. However, the Gujarat HC made it clear to the government and AMC that it does not want to take ‘any chances’ in this matter because it does not want a similar incident to happen in Ahmedabad like the one in Mumbai. The petition in the Gujarat High Court claimed that across various areas of the city, including Sindhu Bhavan Road, Judges Bungalow Road, and Science City, hoardings, banners, and large flex banners are being put up illegally and without permission from AMC. In an earlier hearing, the petitioner stated that these hoardings and banners pose a threat to the safety and security of the citizens. Especially during the monsoon season, heavy winds, storms and cyclones can cause these large hoardings and banners to fall, leading to serious injuries or death of citizens and commuters.

In private colleges, over 1,400 seats are vacant in BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) and BCA ( (Bachelor of Computer Applications) courses, reports suggest. Out of 2,218 seats at 13 BCA colleges, 662 seats are vacant. In BBA, 785 out of 1,502 remain vacant. In all, 3,720 BBA-BCA seats remain to be filled . From July 16, colleges will convert reserved seats into open and admit students based on merit. This process will continue till July 18. On the other hand, Gujarat University-affiliated grant-in-aid  law colleges are facing staff shortages, which is likely to drag the admission process till August. For many years, the universities granted law colleges have not been granted renewal permission by the council due to the non-provision of staff. Last year, Gujarat University-affiliated law colleges filed a petition in the Gujarat High Court where the government had approved staff for only one class each. Meanwhile, this year the high court ordered the council to conduct college inspections and submit a report. The council is currently conducting inspections in the colleges.

Green is the new gold? Ahmedabad veggie prices up by 75-300%,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-vegetable-prices-up-by-75-to-300-per-cent,2024-07-16,16,07,2024,"﻿ The recent rains may have brought some respite from the scorching heat, but temperatures are rising in Gujarat’s kitchens. Prices of daily staples – onions, tomatoes and potatoes have gone up by 75-300% compared to the cost of these vegetables in May-June. “Tomatoes, potatoes, and onions are our basic ingredients. We are a family of 10, being supported by the earnings of just two people,” says Madhu Thakor, who works as a domestic help, “We have now shifted to pulses as we cannot afford vegetables.” Makarba, where Madhu lives, has seen tomatoes retail at a steep ₹120 per kilogram recently. Just a few weeks ago, you could get a kilo for ₹40–50 from your favourite street vendor. In Jamalpur, tomatoes now wholesale at ₹80 a kg. At the Agriculture Produce Market Corporation (APMC) in Vasna, potatoes sell for ₹35 per kg, onions for ₹45 per kg, and garlic for ₹250 per kg. For context, a vendor in Makarba told Gujarat Samachar Digital that he was selling potatoes and onions for ₹20–₹30 per kg this past summer. Garlic now retails at ₹300 per kg. According to the price monitoring division (PMD) of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, on July 7, the average retail price of tomatoes was ₹59.87 per kg, more than 70% up from ₹35 a month earlier. The price surge isn’t limited to these staples. Leafy greens have also seen dramatic increases, with fenugreek (methi) retailing at ₹150 per kg, up from its usual ₹30–40. Coriander (dhaniya), a common garnish, now retails for ₹100 per kg retail, prompting vendors to abandon the tradition of offering it free with purchases. Monsoon surge? Several factors contribute to this vegetable crisis and the ongoing monsoon season is partly to blame. Excessive rain in Himachal Pradesh has damaged roads, and delayed arrivals of vegetable imports from Kerala and Karnataka. “The tomatoes we get here come from Karnataka. Supply has been short because summer was rough this year,” explains Pradeep Chauhan, taking a break from choosing the produce he will later sell on his online platform. “Supply is lower than demand, and transportation costs vendors money.” We are in the narrow lane beneath the Ashok Bhatt flyover in Jamalpur, which acts as a middle ground between the wholesale APMC market and retailers. Buyers – traders, homemakers, and retailers alike – have trained themselves to focus more on the produce than on the vendors who compete with the buzzing of flies and the roar of traffic to pitch their wares. “The eastern part of the city, where I live, is believed to be less expensive. But we paid ₹120 for a kg of tomatoes. Almost every vegetable costs at least ₹40 for 250 g, which wreaks havoc with our budget. Then again, what option do we have?” moaned one shopper, asking not to be named. Type of vegetable Retail price before June 2024 (per kg) Retail price in mid-July 2024 (per kg) Wholesale price in mid-July 2024 (per kg) Tomato ₹40-50 ₹120 ₹80 Potato ₹25-30 ₹60 ₹35 Onion ₹25-30 ₹50 ₹45 Garlic ₹100-150 ₹300–₹350 ₹250 Methi (fenugreek) ₹60 ₹150 ₹60 Dhaniya (Coriander) ₹60 ₹100 ₹50 Rippling repercussions The impact extends beyond individual households. According to a report by the global analytics company CRISIL, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali rose by 10% year-on-year in June 2024. The report, published earlier this month, attributes this increase primarily to the surge in prices of tomatoes (30%), onions (46%), and potatoes (59%). “Tomatoes, onions and potatoes have been the key contributors to this rise as adverse weather conditions have impacted their supply,” said Pushan Sharma, Director-Research, CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics. As Ahmedabad moves deeper into the monsoon season, both residents and traders will be hoping for some relief in the coming weeks. Until then, the humble vegetable remains a premium commodity.

Gujarat HC orders PGVCL to compensate parents of minor electrocuted by open wires in 2012,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-hc-orders-pgvcl-to-compensate-parents-of-minor-electrocuted-by-open-wires-in-2012,2024-07-16,16,07,2024,"After a prolonged fight of over a decade, the Gujarat High Court upheld an order issued by the District Court of Junagadh and ordered Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited (PGVCL) to compensate the parents of the boy who died of electrocution in 2012. Justice JC Doshi of the Gujarat High Court on July 15 dismissed the second appeal admission of PGVCL and ordered a compensation of ₹1.9 lakh with 9% interest to the parents of the deceased minor boy. The case dates back to April 26, 2012, when the victim accidentally came in contact with exposed dangling wires of PGVCL while working in a field in Junagadh district. An Civil Court of Junagadh denied compensation to the minor’s guardian. The parents then went to the Junagadh Principal District Judge, who approved the compensation to them for their son’s death on Mar 8, 2019. Dissatisfied with this order, the PGVCL appealed to the Gujarat High Court, raising legal points that according to Rule 77 of the Indian Electricity Rules-1956, the power line should pass above a height of 6.1 metres. Moreover, Rule 77 applies mainly in the case of streets in cities and not in agricultural fields. They argued that in this case the negligence of the minor caused the incident and he came in contact with the 11 KV power line and became a victim of an electric current. In this, the applicant is not guilty of any fault or liability of the electricity company. However, Justice JC Doshi dismissed the appeal of the PGVCL and held the electricity company responsible, ordering it to provide the compensation to the parents.

During the hearing, the GAA argued in its writ petition that some of the proposed rules were impractical and unreasonable, and some provisions could even lead to increased accidents. The association had also argued that the new rules would directly affect its members and that it was important to hear their views and keep their interests in mind. The high court had earlier refused to grant any relief to the GAA before the rules were framed and implemented. However, the government took note of the representations and suggestions made by the GAA and agreed to hear the views of the association's members before finalising the rules. The association withdrew its petition after the high court directed the state government to consider the GAA’s views before notifying rules.

Students suffer as Ahmedabad’s Vivekanand College sealed off by AMC,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/students-suffer-as-ahmedabads-vivekanand-college-sealed-off-by-amc,2024-07-17,17,07,2024,"Vivekanand College The Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has sealed the premises of Vivekanand College, located near the city’s Raipur Darwaja, due to the college’s lack of Building Use (BU) permission and fire No Objection Certificate (NOC). The college has been running various undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) courses in arts, commerce, BEd, and law for years. This has caused significant inconvenience to the students enrolled in various courses who have been forced to take online classes for the past several days. The college has accused AMC of wrongfully sealing the building. The college principal stated, “Despite having BU permission, the corporation has wrongfully sealed the building. This is affecting the academics of the students.” In an attempt to gain the sympathy of the authorities, the college has been organising study sessions for students on the footpath road below the college building for the past few days. The administrative work was reportedly conducted from a shop below the college. Notably, following the TRP Game Zone fire in Rajkot, AMC has sealed various premises and buildings over a lack of fire-BU permissions.",ahmedabad
An outsider’s guide to finance for living in Ahmedabad,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/an-outsiders-guide-to-finance-for-living-in-ahmedabad,2024-07-17,17,07,2024,"Moving to Ahmedabad Ahmedabad’s blend of centuries-old charm and dynamic modern amenities makes it an exciting destination. For some newcomers, cracking the city’s financial code can be as challenging as navigating its famously labyrinthine pols. Whether you’re a student, young professional, or just seeking a change of scene, here’s your no-nonsense guide to Ahmedabad’s living costs. Finding your urban oasis Ahmedabad’s real estate landscape offers diverse options, but location is key. Western parts of the city, such as Prahladnagar and the Satellite Road area, are go-to spots for young professionals, while Navrangpura and CG Road attract the student crowd. Furnished apartments in prime locations can set you back ₹25,000-₹35,000 a month if you value your privacy. However, if you’re open to sharing your life with roommates, this amount could fall significantly to as little as ₹10,000–₹12,000 if you play your cards right. Fair warning though, even if you’re willing to cough up the dough, one realtor warns that many homeowners are wary of letting their properties to ‘bachelors’, as single folks are often called, irrespective of gender. If rentals are proving too problematic, paying guest (PG) accommodations offer a different route to (a temporary) home sweet home in the ₹9,000-₹17,000 range, depending on room size and occupancy. If you’re wondering why the upper range is more expensive than renting a place with roommates, it’s because PG charges often include meals and utilities as well. A realtor told Gujarat Samachar Digital that professionals new to the city generally choose PGs in Prahladnagar, Sindhu Bhavan, Thaltej, SG Highway, Makarba, Satellite, Jodhpur, and Vastrapur as these are closer to their offices. As with rental properties, students seem to prefer Navrangpura and CG Road due to their proximity to a number of colleges. Fuelling up on food While Ahmedabad’s culinary landscape is a feast for the senses, eating out regularly can be expensive and home-cooked meals aren’t always feasible for newcomers. Enter the humble “tiffin” – a service that has proven to be a lifesaver for many a busy urbanite. These meal delivery services offer a wide array of portion sizes and cuisine options to suit your palate, and typically range from ₹2,500 to ₹4,000 monthly. Another option open to renters is to hire a home cook. This is more expensive than signing up for tiffins once, twice, or even three times a day, but does give you more autonomy over ingredients and their quality. Getting around town Ahmedabad’s public transport game is strong. Auto-rickshaws start at ₹20 for short hops, with ₹3 being added to the meter for every 0.2 km after the first 1.2 km. The extensive bus network (AMTS and BRTS) offers rides for as little as ₹5 for a distance of 3 km to ₹30 for 20 km, depending on distance. For longer commutes, the metro (currently operational from APMC market to Motera stadium and Thaltej gaam to Vastral gaam) is your best bet, with fares between ₹5 and ₹25. The bottom line Tallying it all up, expect to budget ₹16,000–₹19,000 monthly for basic living expenses in Ahmedabad. Of course, your mileage may vary depending on lifestyle choices and location preferences. For instance, a furnished, 2BHK rental property that costs ₹25,000–₹27,000 near Vaishnodevi Circle and in Shilaj would typically go up to the ₹28,000–₹29,000 range in Vastrapur and Gurukul, and further up, to ₹30,000–₹35,000 in Prahladnagar and Satellite. So, while living costs can add up, smart choices and local insights can help you make the most of your budget.",ahmedabad

The update, from Gujarat Health Minister and government spokesperson Rushikesh Patel, comes amid growing concerns about the spread of the virus in the state. Patel’s announcement follows a meeting between Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and district collectors, district development officers, and district health officers from across the state to address the Chandipura outbreak, and the impact of recent rains. The Chandipura vesiculovirus (CHPV), which causes the fatal disease seen mostly in children, is believed to be spread by the female phlebotomine sandfly, which is common during the early monsoon. So, state officials will now ramp up the spraying of insecticides in all districts, Patel informed. Urging caution, Patel advised parents and guardians to take children to “big hospitals” in case of high fevers, since early intervention is the only known way to avoid mortality. “Getting the baby treated in the right place can halt the death rate,” he said. The infection has been seen to progress rapidly—from just a high fever in the morning to liver and kidney damage by evening, leading to swelling of the brain tissue and death within 48 hours. While samples are usually sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, any further samples would be tested at the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre in Gujarat, he also said, adding that facilities will also be put in place to aid patients at the district and sub-district level hospitals. On July 17, the National Institute of Virology in Pune confirmed that the death of a four-year-old girl in Aravalli district was caused by CHPV. Gujarat has so far reported a total of 29 suspected cases, with 15 suspected cases already proving to be fatal. All the deceased are minors. Previously, CHPV outbreaks in 2003–04 caused the deaths of more than 300 children across Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.",ahmedabad

In the ongoing Chandrayaan-4 lunar mission, PRL will play a leading role in research for the first time by collecting and preserving samples from the moon, gathered by an Indian robot. The main objective of Chandrayaan-4 is to collect samples and return them. The rocks and lunar dust collected from the moon will be brought to the two PRL laboratories – NanoSIMS lab and the Ex-terra lab. Dr Kuljeet Kaur Marhas, head of the Planetary Science Division at the Planetary Laboratory of PRL, mentioned in an interview that many remnants obtained from space explorations are stored, and samples are preserved at Ahmedabad’s PRL for research on lunar soil, dust, and asteroid samples. She said that recently, PRL’s main labs are collaborating with global researchers from space agencies like America’s NASA, Russia’s Roscosmos, and Japan’s JAXA. “Continuous meteoroids and lunar materials from various locations around the world necessitate an extensive study in one place. At PRL, the team is studying the components of these materials and the atoms and molecules present in space samples,” said Marhas. She also stated that during the 2015-16 moon mission, the aim was to bring India to the global level, beginning with the study of water samples on the moon. However, the current focus is on meteoroids and whatever has fallen on the moon.

Auto rickshaw and taxi drivers have been demanding a halt to two-wheelers operating without commercial number plates by taxi aggregators. However, while some areas in Ahmedabad saw a shutdown by the auto drivers, the green and yellow three-wheelers were roaming freely in other parts, in a strike that failed to resonate with all the drivers. An auto union member told Gujarat Samachar Digital that the auto strike has been implemented in Thaltej, Geeta Mandir, Kalupur railway station, Vastral, Memnagar, Sabarmati railway station, and Navrangpura. Near the Makarba Garden, the union members were found stopping other autos and taxis, and asking them to cancel their rides in protest. A commuter in Makarba told this portal, “I came in an auto from Sarkhej and I did not find any strike there.” Even traffic officials at the ISKCON Cross Roads said that commuters easily got auto rides from the ISKCON auto stand. Why are auto and taxi drivers on strike? Auto rickshaw drivers and taxi drivers allege that taxi aggregators do not pay fares as per RTO regulations. On the other hand, the drivers face harassment due to online applications. “The online registration of two-wheel taxis is illegal, and they are on the roads providing services illegally. Despite knowing that it is illegal, the traffic police, RTO, and the state are allowing aggregator companies to avail the services,” said Saad Mansuri, member of Ahmedabad Riksha Chalak Ekta Union who had gathered with other members in Makarba. “For over 2 years we have been demanding action in this issue. When nothing has been done, we announced the 24-hour strike,” he added. Mansuri emphasised that auto drivers follow all the RTO rules including insurance renewals, yellow number plate, and other costs, while aggregators accept vehicles only based on the RC book. Amid the tall claims of the government of ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ Mansuri went on to say, “What about the women who are unsafe with those bike taxis who are giving them rides illegally?” The Auto Rickshaw Welfare Association has stated, “Despite repeated representations to the government and concerned authorities regarding illegal white number plates on two-wheelers operated by private companies, we even provided photos and videos, but no significant action has been taken.” “The RTO Ahmedabad has taken action against such vehicles thrice and collected lakhs of rupees in fines, and notices have also been issued to the private companies, but we need a permanent solution,” they added. Ahmedabad RTO to conduct drive against violators Meanwhile, the Regional Transport Office (RTO) of Ahmedabad assured the drivers of action against the offenders. Following the assurance, Riksha Ekta Union of Makarba has decided to call off the strike, according to union member Saad Mansuri. “Private aggregators are booking rides for passengers through online apps. It has been observed that non-transport vehicles (with white number plates) are also used by the companies while booking rides,” said the RTO order. The letter, in possession of Gujarat Samachar Digital , mentions that the Ports and Transport Department, Gandhinagar’s letter dated Apr 16, 2021, prohibits aggregation of non-transport vehicles. “The vehicle owners of non-transport vehicles are advised not to connect with these aggregator companies and passengers are advised not to use non-transport (white number plate) rides through the online app,” it read. The letter also mentioned that action would be taken against the aggregator companies as well as the vehicles used in this manner for violation of the permit. A penalty of up to ₹10,000/- for breach of permit will also be imposed. The RTO also said that it will conduct two drives a week to make sure the rules are being followed.",ahmedabad

The strike, which began this morning, saw a large number of taxi drivers gather outside the offices of these companies at Makarba. Raju Rabari, a taxi driver with eight years of service, expressed frustration over the current situation. “We are here on strike because aggregator companies are using us and draining our earnings,” Rabari said. “They charge hefty commissions, leaving us with very little in hand.” One of the key issues highlighted by the striking drivers is the inequality between auto rickshaw fares and taxi fares. Auto drivers receive higher wages despite having similar/less facilities. Moreover, the companies prioritise customer complaints over driver concerns, leading to unnecessary suspensions based on minor issues. Kanji Rabari, another taxi driver, pointed out that private vehicles are being allowed to operate as taxis, even though the government has not officially approved this practice. “Car fares are lower than auto fares,” he emphasised. “We struggle to manage our finances under this unfair system. As the maintenance of the cars is much higher than that of auto rickshaws.” “We are not here to harass anyone,” Kanji Rabari asserted. “We simply want our voices to be  heard, and if necessary, we will escalate our protest to a hunger strike.” The government’s fixed rate of ₹25 per kilometre for taxis are unmet by the companies, and daily ₹49 login charges further burden the drivers. The demands of the striking drivers include: 1. Fair pay: Taxi drivers want fair compensation for their services, without excessive commission deductions. 2. Discontinuing  private vehicles: They insist that private two-wheelers and four-wheelers carrying passengers should not be allowed to ply as taxis. 3.Transparent fare system: Companies should maintain consistent fares throughout the day, rather than adjusting them based on time. Customers are willing to pay the fare displayed in the app. The taxi drivers hope that their collective action will lead to meaningful change and justice for them. The aggregator companies were approached by Gujarat Samachar Digital , but were not available to comment on the issue.

Following the earlier order to check fire safety facilities in various schools, the government administration had sealed pre-schools and other schools to check fire safety facilities. The Gujarat High Court has expressed strong displeasure over this action. The division bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Pranav Trivedi reprimanded the government and authorities, “You were given the order to check fire safety in schools, not to close them. If preschools are closed like this, what will happen to the parents and students? Think about it.” The high court has also directed the government to create specific guidelines for preschools. “There should be no activity of closing or sealing schools under the guise of fire safety. The administration should not misuse its power,” said the HC. The government and authorities have been told to create awareness and implement fire safety measures in schools.

The rescues follow a targeted operation — by the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU), Mahila police East and West, and the Crime Branch — to address concerns that criminal gangs may be forcing children into both begging and drug trafficking. Carried out in two phases, the drive focused on children seen begging at major intersections in areas such as Satellite, Gujarat University, and SG Highway in Ahmedabad. During the drive, officials learnt that agents from rural areas of Rajasthan were luring families with young children to Ahmedabad and other districts of Gujarat promising them daily wages of  ₹150–200. They were then forced into begging, ACP Bharat Patel of the Crime Branch said. Efforts will be made to ensure that the rescued children can continue their education with the help of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, he added.

BJP leader’s son arrested in Ahmedabad car rental scam,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/bjp-leaders-son-arrested-in-ahmedabad-car-rental,2024-07-28,28,07,2024,"Car rental scam in Ahmedabad Prince Mistry, son of the BJP’s Baxipanch Yuva Morcha chief Kanu Mistry, was nabbed from Ahmedabad’s Madhavpura area for defrauding approximately 40 people. Prince took possession of their cars by promising hefty monthly rents and later pawning them to other people. Victims of the scam allege that they had reported the fraud to the police 13 days ago. However, political pressure prevented immediate action against Prince. The police eventually registered the case on July 26, leading the Detection of Crime Branch (DCB) to arrest on July 27. Prince’s massive car rental scam Details of the complaint suggest that Kajal Jadav, a resident of Asarwa, operated the mortuary van at the Civil Hospital. He also owned another car, which his coworker suggested in December 2023, he should rent out to Prince. The coworker stated he would be paid a deposit of ₹50,000 deposit and a monthly rent of ₹33,000 for this deal. Interested, Jadav met Prince, who claimed to have secured a large contract of rental cars. He promised to pay before the 15th of each month. Trusting Prince due to his father Kanu’s association with the BJP, Jadav and others rented out their cars. For the first couple of months, rent payments were made regularly. However, Prince stopped paying most owners, citing delays in bill payments as the reason for the pending dues. When Prince stopped answering calls, the car owners visited his home on July 13, but he was not found. His father, Kanu, denied any connection with Prince. Further investigation revealed that Prince had lied about the contract and had pawned the rented cars to various people. Prince managed to rent over 400 cars across Ahmedabad and other districts, pawning them for amounts ranging from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh based on their value. A list detailing the 44 cars he had rented and pawned was found. From Asarwa alone, Prince rented 54 cars, of which 14 were recovered using GPS tracking. Upon scrutiny, these cars were found with liquor cartons, bags, and bloodstains, suggesting their use for transporting alcohol and animals. An investigation into this matter has been urged. Why were authorities reluctant to take action? Victims claimed that they went to report the fraud to the police, but political pressure made the officials hesitant to file a complaint. Even when the complaint was registered, some details were reportedly omitted by the police. The issue became political, prompting authorities in Gandhinagar to instruct the registration of the case on July 26. Jadav stated that Prince claimed to be working with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and mentioned the BJP’s requirement for several cars to be deployed in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Allegedly, this detail was also omitted from the complaint. Congress MLA Jignesh Mevani said, “Prince Mistry has defrauded numerous people under the pretence of securing a contract from the BJP for Lok Sabha election work. Prince is active in the VHP and Bajrang Dal, and his father is a prominent BJP leader. It’s unlikely Prince could have executed such a large scam without political backing, potentially involving his father. The police should investigate Kanu Mistry and other political figures involved in this case.” गुजरात भाजपा का एक नया भ्रष्टाचार सामने आया है। 2024 के लोकसभा चुनाव में प्रिंस मिस्त्री नामक भाजपा के पदाधिकारी ने अहमदाबाद से 400 जितनी फोर-व्हीलर गाड़ी पार्टी के चुनाव प्रचार के लिए किराये पर ली। बदले में इन गाड़ी मालिकों को 35,000 से 50,000 रुपया किराया प्रति गाड़ी देना… — Jignesh Mevani (@jigneshmevani80) July 28, 2024",ahmedabad

Other demands include: Legal Assistance: Appointment of Special Public Prosecutors for their case. Fast-Track Court: Expedited legal proceedings. Hospital Closure: Permanent cancellation of the hospital's registration and closure of Ramanand Eye Hospital. Activist Kirit Rathod, who accompanied the 17 supplicants to the Secretariat in Gandhinagar, said: “This is injustice! The victims have registered police complaints against the accused, but the state isn’t doing anything for them. Our local MLA Hardik Patel is well aware of the situation, but has not been willing or able to help.

Taking serious note of the issue,a bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Vaibhavi Nanavati held an urgent hearing on July 29 and took to task the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC), Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) for what they termed “is an eyewash”. The court accused these authorities of engaging in a blame game and failing to take decisive action to clean up the Sabarmati. Strict directives were issued to all industrial units, mandating compliance with legal norms and proper treatment of effluent before discharge. Both the GPCB and AMC were ordered to ensure adherence to these regulations. Additionally, the court demanded detailed sworn affidavits from various parties, including the AMC Commissioner regarding the MEGA  pipeline project, and the GPCB regarding the efficiency and condition of Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs). The Joint Task Force (JTF) also received a directive to submit a comprehensive report.

Impending water crisis: Ahmedabad utilises 152% groundwater,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/impending-water-crisis-ahmedabad-utilises-152-groundwater,2024-07-31,31,07,2024,"Soon, the groundwater demands of Ahmedabad would be hard to meet, as the city is currently utilising more than it could reinstate its groundwater. According to the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)’s Dynamic Groundwater Resources Report 2023, Ahmedabad is utilising 152% of its available groundwater. If the current situation persists, groundwater in Ahmedabad will be depleted, leading to a severe water crisis. In 2023, the groundwater recharged in Ahmedabad stood at 13,381.73 ham (groundwater level recharge unit), with rainfall amounting to 8,944.47 ham and other sources recharging 2,026 ham. A total of 2,411.08 ham groundwater came from other sources in the non monsoon season. Dynamic Groundwater Resources Report 2023 Out of this inflow, the environmental flows took away 669.08 ham, leaving the extractable groundwater at 12,712.65 ham. Compared to that, the extraction draft for 2023 stood at 19,423.60 ham, 152% of the intake received. Not only this has left the city with zero available groundwater for the future according to the report, but has put Ahmedabad groundwater reserves in ‘over-exploited’ category. The groundwater was used for irrigation (18,279 ham), industrial (325.24 ham), and domestic needs (819.36 ham). According to the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), while rainfall significantly helps recharge groundwater, the rate of groundwater usage surpassing the recharge rate leads to depletion of reserves. Ahmedabad’s groundwater extraction issue According to central government directives, prior approval is required for constructing borewells to extract groundwater. Additionally, violating the regulations can result in fines up to ₹1 lakh. However, there is no control over borewell construction, leading to unregulated extraction of groundwater. Furthermore, groundwater is also sold commercially in Ahmedabad, according to reports. The government has not formulated a specific policy on this matter, making groundwater depletion inevitable.

"Students claw for air, space in 5K cramped tuition classes in Ahmedabad",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/students-claw-for-air-space-in-5k-cramped-tuition-classes-in-ahmedabad,2024-08-01,1,08,2024,"The tragedy in which three UPSC aspirants lost their lives due to flooding in a New Delhi coaching centre, has raised questions over the safety and legality of tuition classes in Ahmedabad. According to a recent estimate, the city has 5,000 tuition centres operating out of cramped complexes and basements without proper permits or adherence to safety standards. Despite regulations requiring eight square feet of space per student to ensure adequate oxygen, many tuition centres disregard these guidelines. Who’s to blame? An official from the education department noted that campaigns against illegal tuition centres are launched periodically but that parents support these classes by sending their children to study there. “Campaigns are launched at the mass level when the government pressures us, but parents are equally responsible for maintaining this system,” the official said. Notably, the government seems to crack down on illegal private tutors roughly once every decade. The most recent action took place when Anandiben Patel was chief minister; the one before that, when Keshubhai Patel was CM. Tradition with a twist Private tutors are not illegal per se. And they certainly aren’t new. There is a long tradition of students needing special attention to supplement school learning, and teachers — usually unemployed BEd graduates — filling this gap. Today, however, schoolteachers are often forced to supplement meagre incomes from their day job with private classes. This means parents have to shell out tuition fees of up to ₹1,000 per subject per month for primary school students and ₹1,500 per subject per month for high school students, on top of already high school fees. According to one schoolteacher who runs a “coaching class”, hers is one of about 3,000 such centres in Ahmedabad. Naranpura, Maninagar, Bapunagar, Ranip, Paldi, Satellite, and Vadaj areas account for the bulk of such centres in the city, she added. Adding to the complexity of the issue is the large number of engineering graduates in the private tuition business. As these tuition classes operate without legal recognition, they are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as, say, schools. Without proper certification and standards, they cannot be penalised for the quality of “coaching” education or lack of safety protocols. The situation underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to address the proliferation of unregulated tuition centres.

The HC said that the traffic drive should be 24x7 for 365 days instead of 15 days. The bench comprising Justice Alpesh Kogje and Justice Sameer Dave stated that citizens do not pay taxes to face inconvenience. Despite orders from the Chief Justice to prohibit illegal parking and entry of luxury buses into the city, Ghatlodia PI V D Mori refused to comply and responded to enforcement requests dismissively. The Court, led by Justices Kogje and Dave, reprimanded the government and police department for such irresponsibility, emphasising the necessity of taking action against officers who disregard court orders. Highlighting the seriousness of traffic and illegal parking issues, the high court gave the state government, traffic police, and AMC a week’s time to take immediate and effective action. The high court summoned the chief secretary of state Raj Kumar to the next hearing on Aug 8. The Gujarat HC also said that traffic drives were done on a few roads but the issues of parking and traffic mismanagement plagued the whole city. It demanded a permanent solution to the problems.

AMC plan to lease out Kankaria lakefront raises eyebrows,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/amc-plan-to-lease-out-kankaria-lakefront-raises-eyebrows,2024-08-02,2,08,2024,"The Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has sparked controversy by inviting bids to lease out the Kankaria Lakefront for two years. This move means a private agency will manage the popular public space. The request for proposal (RFP) issued by the AMC includes the historic Kankaria Lake, Kid’s City, and the Nocturnal Zoo. To upgrade the Kankaria Lakefront and its associated facilities as per the current requirements and provide amenities to visitors, the AMC has invited bids for operation and maintenance. The facilities created at the cost of crores of rupees  collected from the taxpayer will now be used to generate profit for the government. Initially, the operation and maintenance of the lakefront will be handed over to an agency for two years. The service provider will be required to provide manpower at 60 points, including 10 ticket counters at the lakefront, 30 points at Kid’s City, three points for protocol services, two bus assistants, two supervision points, one system administrator, and 12 service points at the Nocturnal Zoo. Kid’s City will be contracted on a PPP (Public Private Partnership)  basis. Jayesh Trivedi, chairman of the AMC’s Recreation Committee, stated that there is no such consideration at present. The renovation of Balvatika has begun. Similarly, the renovation of other activities will also be carried out in phases. There is no possibility of handing over the entire complex on a PPP basis. Dev Chaudhary, deputy commissioner of the South Zone, which oversees the Kankaria Lakefront, stated that there is no consideration to hand over the entire complex for operation and maintenance. Such a plan may be for one or two activities. However, this statement contradicts the fact that the AMC’s website has advertised for such a proposal.

Bhojak and his aide, government-approved engineer Ashish Patel, were caught red-handed, accepting a ₹20 lakh bribe. According to the complaint filed by a builder in the city, the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) demolished the shops and houses built on his inherited land and took over the land. Subsequently, he and the affected tenants initiated legal proceedings, during which they were instructed to present evidence regarding the land at the AMC office. Meanwhile, they also met Patel, who introduced them to Bhojak. The latter offered to make “alternative arrangements” in favour of the landowner. In return, he demanded ₹50 lakh as a bribe. The landowner bargained Bhojak down to ₹20 lakh, and informed the ACB of the situation. Following the lead, the ACB set a trap in the Akshar Space Infra office at Ratnakar Business Square on Ashram Road, where they caught Bhojak and Patel in the act. The ACB arrested the duo and searched the office as well as the residences of both accused. The raid in Bhojak’s Pragatinagar residence yielded ₹73 lakh in cash,  and a gold biscuit worth ₹4 lakh, both of which have been seized as the ACB continues its investigation.

Bhojak has been a subject of multiple investigations and many complaints have been filed against him. Bhojak was found to be involved in several corruption controversies in the past. Deputy Municipal Commissioner Arjav Shah stated that Bhojak was issued a show-cause notice in August 2023 for allegedly conspiring with the builder of Sana Apartments, a 10-storey building in Jamalpur ward. Another show-cause notice was issued to him in January 2023 for irregularities found at a construction site in Nikol. Following Bhojak’s arrest, Municipal Commissioner M Thennarasan has suspended him and revoked two of his increments. Meanwhile, Ashish Patel, Bhojak’s accomplice, and a government-approved engineer, does not hold a valid licence to work as an architect or engineer in the AMC. He was involved in illegal construction activities colluding with Bhojak. The Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporations (GPMC) Act, 1949, states that any entity wishing to practise as an architect or engineer for the city’s administrative projects must obtain a formal licence by registering with the AMC. Illicit deeds at structural level The city’s former mayor and current Ellisbridge MLA, Amit Shah, along with former Khadia corporator Mayur Dave and Jamalpur-Khadia MLA Imran Khedawala, had requested information from the estate department regarding illegal constructions in the central zone. However, the estate department failed to provide the information citing the unavailability of the papers, leading to penalties being imposed on Bhojak, along with ward inspectors of Dariapur and Khadia, Girish Patel and S J Kadalia, respectively. Moreover, despite a 2020 request for CCTV footage of the estate department under the Right to Information Act, Bhojak repeatedly delayed providing the video recordings. As a result, he was slapped with a fine by the Gujarat Information Commission (GIC). Bhojak was also responsible for approving repairs and restorations of heritage buildings in the walled city area. However, he is accused of allowing numerous heritage buildings to be converted into commercial complexes. Notably, when AMC’s estate and town planning committee met on August 2, the chairperson, Pritish Mehta, was quizzed extensively regarding Bhojak’s bribery case. Mehta evaded responsibility by placing the blame squarely on the AMC officials, asking, “What did the officials do? What is their responsibility?” Also read: Red-handed: ACB nabs AMC official taking ₹20 lakh bribe",ahmedabad

"In this diet-crazy world, what will keep you healthy?",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/health/in-this-diet-crazy-world-what-will-keep-you-healthy,2024-08-06,6,08,2024,"With a growing attention on wellness, young people are increasingly adopting dietary trends in pursuit of a healthier lifestyle. However, the need for quick fixes and the influence of social media often lead to impulsive diet choices without considering individual needs. Experts warn that such haphazard approaches can be dangerous to health. Palak Shah, a certified nutritionist with over two decades of experience, emphasises the importance of personalised nutrition. “Every individual is unique, and so are their dietary requirements,” she says. “Blindly following a diet trend without understanding one’s body type can lead to serious health consequences.” Shah cautions against the dangers of DIY (Do it yourself) nutrition, stating that without professional guidance, individuals risk experiencing dizziness, irritation, fatigue, and other health issues. “While you might lose weight, it could be at the expense of your overall health,” she warns. Divya Goswami, a certified nutritionist and fitness coach, highlights the importance of sustainable diets that incorporate a variety of foods. “Eliminating entire food groups is not healthy,” she says. The obsession with achieving the perfect body has led to a rise in restrictive diets, such as no-sugar and low-carb plans. While these may seem appealing, experts caution against their indiscriminate adoption. “No-sugar diets can be harmful as the body requires natural sugars for energy,” says Goswami. She recommends cutting back on artificial and processed sugars while incorporating natural sugars from fruits and other sources. Low-carb diets, while effective for some, may not be suitable for everyone. “Individual needs vary, and what works for one person might not work for another,” says Goswami. Protein is another crucial component of a healthy diet. It plays a vital role in muscle building, hormonal balance, and energy levels. While protein supplements are often promoted, Goswami recommends prioritising natural protein sources. “Supplements should be considered only after exhausting natural options,” she advises. Recommended dosage of protein for everyone: At least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily. For active or moderately active persons: 2.25 grams per kilogram. Calorie intake: 1600 to 2,400 calories per day for women, 2,000 to 3,000 calories for men as per requirements. Vegetarian breakfast Goswami suggests poha, idli, dosa, or paratha in moderation. She recommends to opt for idli or dosa as they are made from fermented batter, and fermentation boosts gut health. You can have the paratha with ghee as ghee is a rich source for vitamins and antioxidants. Moong dal chilla or Besan chilla is also a great breakfast option. Pair your favourite breakfast meal with milk, fruits, and a protein-packed addition like peanut butter, suggests Shah. For lunch Shah suggests having wheat roti with your favourite vegetable like bhindi or potato, a side salad, and a dollop of curd for lunch. Including dahi with your midday meal helps in digestion. For dinner You can choose from options like paneer, tofu, or simply cooked vegetables along with whole grains. Keep dinner light and avoid late-night snacking. And if you have mid-day cravings, you can opt for puffed rice or makhna (foxnuts). Also read : Benefits of exercise, diet akin to psychological treatment for depression: Study",ahmedabad

The bench of Chief Justice Sunita Aarwal and Justice Pranav Trivedi had welcomed the petitioner’s environmental concerns regarding constructing the Panjrapol flyover but also directed to cover other issues including traffic in the city and increasing accidents. The chief justice expressed concern over the complex problem of traffic and the increasing number of young people dying in accidents, making a poignant remark that the Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway near the High Court intersects at this bridge, where many accidents have been reported. “We have witnessed this ourselves. Traffic and the increasing number of accidents in the city are a serious problem,” said the chief justice emphasising the urgent need for integrated planning. A public interest litigation has been filed raising the issue that the authorities are planning to construct another flyover bridge from Panjarapol Cross Road to IIM. Still, there is no need for this bridge. Moreover, there is already a bridge at a distance of 275 metres, so there is no need for this new flyover. The AMC authorities were on an incessant drive to cut down the years-old trees in this area. This has caused great dissatisfaction and shock among the residents and environmentalists.

Ahmedabad University levies a fee of ₹4.6 lakh annually for courses like BA, BCom, BSc, and BS. The fee for MBA programs is ₹5 lakh, while BTech programs are charged ₹3.5 lakh. While the fees for technical courses like B.Tech and MBA are regulated by a government committee, the fees for other undergraduate courses are not bound by such regulations, allowing the university to charge arbitrarily. The university had closed the main gate to prevent any disturbances, but the determined NSUI activists and students breached the barrier. This led to a ruckus, prompting the police to intervene. Several NSUI members were detained to control the situation. The NSUI had previously staged a protest, demanding a reduction in fees, citing the excessive costs and the lack of regulation for non-technical courses. Ahmedabad University offers fee concessions and scholarships to students from families with an annual income of less than ₹10 lakh. However, the NSUI argues that these measures are insufficient and that the overall fee structure is unaffordable for many students, especially those from economically weaker backgrounds.

However, the messages were often deleted by her. Suspicious of the messages, Disha confided in her colleague, explaining that Damoliya, her maternal uncle, had repeatedly raped her in the company office promising her a lavish future. Disha warned her colleague to stay away from him. Furthermore, Disha had recorded her conversations with Damoliya and sent the video to the colleague for safekeeping. It was also revealed to the colleague that Disha was pregnant. Thirteen days before she committed suicide, a pregnancy test confirmed she was one-month pregnant. Disha had even undergone a medical examination at a hospital in Vejalpur. Based on the complaint, Vejalpur police have registered a case and launched an investigation. Vejalpur Police Inspector R M Chauhan said, “In the case of Disha’s suicide, we have gathered significant evidence against the accused, including Instagram chats between the deceased and Laxman Damoliya. Moreover, a gynaecologist’s report and chats between Disha’s colleague and Laxman are also recorded. We searched the accused’s pharma company and residence, but he was not found. We will soon nab him.”",ahmedabad

Frequent glitches in RTO server causing financial losses to two-wheeler dealers,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/frequent-glitches-in-rto-server-causing-financial-losses-to-wo-wheeler-dealers,2024-08-07,7,08,2024,"Two-wheeler dealers in Gujarat are facing financial losses due to persistent technical glitches in the Regional Transport Office (RTO) server. The online portal, crucial for processing vehicle registrations and tax payments, has been experiencing frequent breakdowns, resulting in substantial losses for dealers. Dealers are mandated to make online payments for RTO charges when selling a two-wheeler. However, the portal often crashes during the payment process, leading to deductions from dealer accounts without generating necessary receipts or completing the registration process. To compound the issue, refunds for these failed transactions have been delayed or denied in many cases. Industry sources estimate that over 12,000 dealers across the state have been affected, with total losses amounting to lakhs of rupees. The dealers have urged the RTO to address the server issues promptly and implement a robust refund mechanism. “We are facing immense financial difficulties due to the RTO’s unreliable system,” said a dealer. “The frequent crashes and delayed refunds are impacting our business operations significantly.” While the RTO’s Sarathi portal, used for licence-related services, is relatively stable, the vehicle portal has been plagued with problems. Despite complaints, the issue persists, causing distress to the dealers. The dealers have demanded a swift resolution to the problem, including the implementation of a system to automatically generate payments again and initiate refunds for failed transactions. They have also called for improved server infrastructure to prevent future disruptions. The RTO has not yet issued an official statement in the matter.

The disruptions in cross-border trade and the impending uncertainty have created ripples through this industry. The dyeing sectors in Ahmedabad’s Naroda, Vatva, and Odhav areas have been significantly affected, given their extensive transactional dealings of ₹800-₹1000 crore with Bangladesh. The Gujarat Dyestuffs Manufacturers’ Association (GDMA) chairperson Bhupendra Patel said that reactive dyes are exported to Bangladesh on a large scale to process fabrics and coloring them. “Approximately 10-12% of the nation’s total chemical exports are directed to Bangladesh. However, these exports are currently at a standstill. It is estimated that the value of reactive dye exports from India to Bangladesh exceeds ₹2500 crores,” said Patel. According to the GDMA chairperson, Usually, they receive a letter of credit (LC) payment within 90 days, but due to political tensions in Bangladesh, many consignments have been stopped midway. Some consignments are stuck at the India-Bangladesh border. As a result, payments are delayed, and goods in transit are also stuck, said the GDMA head. Sources from the chemical industry revealed that to avoid losses of suppliers in India, textile association heads have been contacted in Bangladesh to assess the situation. Bangladesh businesspersons have suggested that the situation is likely to calm down soon. Once the instability subsides, normal trade and economic transactions will resume.

According to an official at the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), no instructions or guidelines have been given to the students yet. The ICCR facilitates student exchange between India and Bangladesh. Around 300 Bangladeshi students were expected to study in Gujarat universities this year. However, final admissions are yet to be confirmed, and the intensifying unrest in their home country has left their futures uncertain.

Justice Divyesh Joshi of the high court stated, “Tolerance should be the foundation of marital life. However, it is often observed that relatives from the wife’s side make mountains out of mole.” “Instead of making all possible efforts to improve and save a deteriorating marriage, often due to resentment towards the husband and his family members, actions are taken that lead to the complete breakdown of marital life over trivial matters,” the court observed. Justice Joshi said that the wife’s parents and relatives are often the first responders to contact the police. They think that the police are the solution to all their problems. He said tolerance to a certain extent regarding each other’s faults should be natural in any marriage. Minor issues and trivial disputes are part of domestic life and should not be exaggerated. If a case is filed by a woman against the husband and his relatives out of resentment, the court should take a practical approach and read ‘between the lines’, said Justice Joshi. The high court, taking serious note of the FIR allegations, stated, “In this case, the marital dispute seems to be between husband and wife, and, as usual, all family members of the husband have been included as accused. After a thorough investigation of the complete facts, the complaint filed by the wife appears to be nothing but an abuse of legal process,” the court observed.",ahmedabad

A bench of Justices A Y Kogje and Samir J Dave expressed strong dissatisfaction with the lack of effective measures by the state government, police, and Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in tackling these issues. The deputy municipal commissioner filed an affidavit in court, admitting that there has been no significant improvement in the situation. Slamming the lack of progress, the bench warned that if the situation does not improve, it may need to take further steps. The court’s reprimand extends to government officials, noting that some use their official vehicles for personal errands. The high court has mandated the municipal commissioner to personally oversee and report on action taken against these violations. Additionally, the court has observed that while encroachments are periodically cleared, vendors often return to the same locations, signalling  a need for a more durable solution. It has questioned the apparent inaction in removing illegally parked vehicles and instructed authorities to remove such vehicles from public roads and footpaths without delay. The court stated that lower-ranked police officers had invested in shuttle rickshaws, so action was not taken against them.These officers have a system of code words or signals, so that action is not taken against the violators. Higher-level officers can break the connections, the court said. The court’s strict directives aimed at ensuring a cleaner, more accessible public space, set a clear mandate for authorities to act promptly against illegal practices. The high court directed the government and authorities to implement its orders and submit a status report by August 20. A follow-up hearing has been scheduled for that date.

The police have filed a case against the notorious mafia operator Raman Patel and nine others in this case. The CID Crime had previously booked Patel and his associates for fraudulently embezzling lands in various areas. A complaint filed by Kanu Thakor, a resident of Kheda’s Nani Kaloli village, states that his grandmother Gajri Thakor had two daughters, Jeevat and Babu. Since they had no sons, both daughters were the direct heirs to their land in Makarba. Gajri Thakor passed away in 1980. Jeevat, the complainant’s mother, passed away in 2017, and Babu passed away in 2006. After this, the children of Jeevat and Babu were the heirs to this land. However, as there was no one to look after the land at that time, Raman Patel conspired with Manilal Shah, Gautam Trikamlal, Ramu Bharwad, Hitesh Patel, Becharji Thakor, and Chandulal Thakor to grab the land. Manilal created a sale deed in 1986 stating that he had purchased the Makarba land from Gajri’s mother. Subsequently, showing Ramu Bharwad as the power of attorney of Gajri and Karsan, he cancelled the 1986 sale deed. He created another one by forging Gajri’s thumb impression. The other accused were recorded as witnesses in this document. Additionally, a fake death certificate was also created mentioning Gajri’s death to be in 1992. Following the complaint, CID Crime has initiated further investigation into the matter.",ahmedabad

Guj HC orders AMC to produce all records related to Panjrapol flyover,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/guj-hc-orders-amc-to-produce-all-records-related-to-panjrapol-flyover,2024-08-12,12,08,2024,"Hearing on the writ filed against the construction of the Panjrapol flyover, the Gujarat Court made some serious observations and has now ordered AMC to produce all records related to the flyover. The Bench consisting of Justice Sunita Agrawal and Pranav Trivedi, stated that, considering the reports of the expert bodies placed on record in the present writ petition, the matter of road planning by AMC requires serious relook. The HC has now ordered AMC to produce before the court all the records and materials related to the decision-making process for the construction of the flyover on the Dr Vikram Sarabhai Marg (IIM Road) from Panjarapol Junction. The bench noted that, according to the IITRAM (Institute of Infrastructure Technology Research and Management) and CSIR (Central Road Research Institute, New Delhi) reports, the proposal of flyover at this junction is an exercise carried out in complete disregard of the recommendations of IITRAM and CSIR. IITRAM and CSIR had presented a comprehensive report of 34 junctions of Ahmedabad in 2010. Another traffic study report was also presented in 2012 by these two organizations for improvement of junctions along major road corridors in Ahmedabad. The petitioner brought to the notice of the court the fact that the AMC authorities are constructing the Panjarapole flyover by ignoring the recommendations of the reports of these two bodies. The petition in Gujarat High Court has raised the following issues with construction of Panjrapol flyover- There is no need for a flyover from Panjrapole Cross Road to IIM because there is already one flyover. The construction of this flyover will result in the felling of old trees, which is unacceptable from an environmental perspective. This entire area is green cover. Ahmedabad has already lost 48% of its green cover since 2011. Traffic on this road has decreased by 15% in 2020 compared to 2012, eliminating a need for the flyover. The Ranjit Buildcon company, which has been awarded the contract to build this bridge, has a poor track record. Allowing the construction of such a bridge for the sole purpose of earning profits for the contractor company at the expense of the environment cannot be permitted. Since there is no need for a flyover, the High Court should not grant permission for its construction. Construction company’s poor track record The petitioner’s side also brought to the High Court’s attention that the Ranjit Buildcon Ltd and Ranjit Construction Company are both part of the same group, which has a very bad and poor track record. The group is involved in serious irregularities related to construction. In Surat, during the construction of a road widening project between Jamnaba Park and Anuvrat Dwar, a two-year-old died, and many laborers were also injured. With the Sabarmati Riverfront project, Ranjit Buildcon Ltd was awarded the contract for a specific part of Phase 2, and they had constructed an artificial sewage bridge that collected contaminated sewage waste and obstructed the flow of water in the river.

The seizure came on August 10, following a joint operation involving the Ahmedabad Cyber Crime and Customs department at the Foreign Post Office in Ahmedabad’s Shahibaug area. The Ahmedabad Cyber Crime department has registered a case and launched an investigation. The contraband was found hidden in food packets, toys, air purifiers, ladies' footwear and other items. Fourteen of the seized parcels were sent from the UK, 10 from the US, nine from Canada, two from Thailand and one from Spain, and were meant to be delivered to Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Vapi, Diu, and Daman. Officials said that the traffickers used fake names and addresses. In Ahmedabad, the parcels were set to be delivered to Bopal, Bodakdev, Amraiwadi, and Satellite areas. Recurring issue DCP Lavina Sinha and Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP, cybercrime) Hardik Makhdiya led the operation after Cyber Crime and Customs officers received information that suspicious parcels at the Foreign Post Office in Shahibaug contained drugs. However, this is hardly a new development. Two similar seizures in June yielded a combined 22 kg of the drug, worth a total of about ₹7 crore. Cyber Crime officials say this is a countrywide issue, with traffickers using the dark web, fake social media accounts, codes, and ever-changing IP addresses to conduct their business. Hybrid strains — typically a mix of sativa and indica strains, the two main types of cannabis plants — are often bred to have higher THC content, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis. The higher potency and varied effects can also increase risks associated with cannabis use. Notably, cannabidiol (CBD) oil extracted from the hemp plant — which is legal in India, and has medicinal uses — does not contain THC. However, its import is highly controlled.

Bagula circle, Makarba ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ The Bagula circle  – an intersection near Makarba Talati Office and 31Five commercial building is hell for commuters from 9 to 10 am and 7 to 8 pm. What makes this intersection a mess is the roads leading to it are plagued by illegally parked cars, reckless drivers, and impatient commuters. Illegally parked car outside Makarba Talati Office A large number of vehicles are illegally parked on the roads, most of which belong to employees who work at Westgate Bay, a corporate office between Makarba Talati Office and the newly constructed LC26 underpass. Hitendra Makwana, an official of AMC’s estate department said that they hardly received any complaints from this area as it is less residential and more corporate and commercial. Makwana advises commuters to use the citizen complaint call centre number ‘155303’ to lodge any complaint regarding civic issues. Moreover, for traffic related problems, one can dial ‘1095’, the traffic helpline number of Ahmedabad police. “There are many employees in this coworking commercial building. It has banks, IT offices, and other corporate offices. However, only a few are given the basement access, so we are forced to park outside,” says an employee working at Westgate Bay. Notably, there is a parking space near the building where only 2-3 vehicles are parked, leaving most of the area empty. The security guard says, “This parking space belongs only to employees working on the first floor.” Commuters’ plight Jaydeep, a two-wheeler rider who travels every day from his office at Corporate Road towards Sarkhej, says, “Daily I am caught in traffic and get stuck for 30 minutes. People park anywhere. The traffic can be managed if the AMC’s estate department removes all the illegally parked cars and two-wheelers.” Another commuter in his car, Mahendra Sahu, says, “This road suddenly faces congestion in peak hours as there is no ‘traffic sense’ in public.” A man who volunteers daily to manage the traffic says, “At this junction, commuters are reckless and impatient to go home and there is a lack of traffic sense.” He suggested  that there should be Traffic Regulatory Brigade (TRB) officials as this road can be managed with minimal cooperation from the public and efforts of traffic police. Long wait time at Prahladnagar crossroads Prahladnagar cross road traffic Commuters coming from Corporate Road once again encounter a long wait time at Prahladnagar crossroads and have to wade through heavy traffic till they get to clear the signal. Here are the signal timings of Prahladnagar Garden intersection during peak hours, which is somehow a factor resulting in traffic. From Towards Red countdown Green countdown Corporate Road Prahlad Nagar Garden 118 24 Prahlad Nagar Garden Corporate Road 14 123 Anand Nagar SG Highway 104 18 SG Highway Anand Nagar 104 18 According to operations document of Ahmedabad Traffic Management and Information Control Centre (TMICC), traffic is managed by the City Traffic Police, while the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) installs and maintains equipment (signals). “We have intimated traffic police N division Police Inspector P A Marwada about the long red light timing and she will soon report it to AMC officials who will then change the signal timings for this intersection,” said Police Constable Ranchhod Rabari present at the Prahladnagar traffic beat. Regarding the traffic at Prahladnagar junction, Assistant City Engineer Kamlesh Damor says, “We have not received any such congestion problem yet in the area.” Also read: HC orders strict action against vehicles parked on roads, footpaths, seeks status report on Aug 20",ahmedabad
A’bad schools outsourcing academics to coaching institutes,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-schools-outsourcing-academics-to-coaching-institutes,2024-08-14,14,08,2024,"Dummy schools In another incident where the education of students has been blatantly compromised in Gujarat, some schools in Ahmedabad’s Ghatlodia and Ranip areas have relieved their science stream teachers and handed over the academic responsibility entirely to coaching faculties. The coaching class teachers are reported to be determining the timings and fees for the students of Classes 11 and 12 in these schools. Subsequently, students are transferred to coaching centres instead of attending regular school. Sources privy to such incidents have revealed that the school management has also relinquished the administration, allowing a new private education system to take over reigns in these schools. This ‘dummy school’ culture prevalent in the science stream asks students to only attend classes to mark their presence. Their academic curriculum, however, is taken care of in the coaching classes. Ill-effect on mental health A psychiatrist practising in Ahmedabad mentions that most of the mental health-related cases involving students from Classes 11 and 12 show high levels of stress. Among these, students enrolled in dummy schools form a significant proportion. Approximately 80% of these students seek counselling due to academic pressure or the inability to engage in their preferred activities. “These students often experience heightened exam stress but become passive. We advise such children to take a break from studies and engage in activities they enjoy to help them return to a normal state,” they said. “Even if dummy school students achieve good marks, they often exhibit personality disorders,” the psychiatrist remarked. Raju Gadhvi, retired principal of Diwan Ballubhai School, commented on this issue, stating, “Only a school can provide holistic development. This is impossible in coaching classes.” He further added, “The mindset of focussing solely on marks is harming students. Classes 11 and 12 are crucial years during adolescence, where leadership, sports, and cultural activities play a vital role. If a child’s focus is entirely shifted to academics during these years, it can have numerous adverse effects on their mental well-being.”",ahmedabad
Gujarat High Court reprimands police for misuse of power,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-high-court-reprimands-police-for-misuse-of-power,2024-08-14,14,08,2024,"Gujarat High Court The Gujarat High Court severely reprimanded the Ahmedabad Crime Branch and the city’s Ghatlodia Police for the misuse of power and torture inflicted on innocent citizens in a minor traffic violation case. In a significant directive to senior police officials, the court has emphasised the need for strict vigilance over subordinates who harass citizens unnecessarily and attempt to establish dominance by resorting to violence. During the hearing, Justice Nirzar S Desai questioned the legality of the Crime Branch officer’s action in stopping a citizen from driving on the wrong side, asserting that only traffic police can enforce traffic rules and regulations. The court ordered the Joint Police Commissioner of the Crime Branch to present CCTV footage regarding the allegations of torture in custody. The court was informed that the CCTV footage backup in this case was only kept for one month, and efforts were being made to retrieve the footage from June 9, which led to the court's strong displeasure. Guj HC slam police for arm-bending Justice Desai, hearing this case, remarked, “Senior officers may be humble, but they should keep an eye on their subordinates who roam around the city, harassing people and trying to establish their dominance through unnecessary assaults. No police officer has the right to beat any citizen unnecessarily to satisfy their ego.” Justice Desai also heavily criticised Ghatlodia police inspector (PI) V D Mori for creating a case favouring an Ahmedabad Crime Branch officer by citing anonymous witnesses. The court sternly warned the police, stating, “Is the officer investigating the case omniscient that he found four witnesses in 24 hours? If the police think they can outsmart the court, then the court will show them how to use its power.” The Gujarat High Court, while quashing an FIR and related proceedings against the petitioners under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS). Later, a Crime Branch constable stated that both parties had settled, leading the High Court to dismiss the complaint in this case. The High Court issued a severe warning to the police, stating, “You can use reasonable force against hardened criminals, but don’t look at every citizen with the same lens and use your power to entrap innocents.” A traffic violation which severely escalated This case pertains to an incident a few days ago when Crime Branch constable Janak Gor stopped two citizens for driving on the wrong side under Chandlodia Bridge and an altercation ensued.

"Watch your back! Poor Ahmedabad roads can cause of back pain, say experts",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/poor-ahmedabad-roads-can-cause-of-back-pain-say-experts,2024-08-14,14,08,2024,"Even light showers in Ahmedabad cause potholes in the city, leading to back problems for the city commuters. Due to the potholes, the number of patients with back pain has increased by about 30%, believes an orthopaedic doctor. Surge in orthopaedic cases Poor road conditions have led to an increase in back pain, sciatica, and related bone disorders. This has caused a surge in orthopaedic cases in both private and government hospitals. At Ahmedabad’s Civil hospitals in Asarwa and Sola, there has been a significant rise in orthopaedic cases. At Civil Hospital’s orthopaedic department in Asarwa, an average of 60 out of 100 daily patients suffer from back pain. According to orthopaedic doctors, regular driving over potholes can lead to back pain and sciatica issues. Dr Piyush Mittal, Director of the Spine Institute at Civil Hospital, mentioned that there is a general increase in back pain cases during the monsoon. For individuals with bone-related issues, driving over potholes can lead to back pain and issues with the spinal column. It’s advisable to drive slowly when encountering potholes to avoid worsening the condition. Back pain is also increasing among young people due to sedentary lifestyles, long drives, poor road conditions, and carrying heavy bags. Advice for commuters - Those already suffering from back pain or cervical issues should wear lumbar-sacral belts or cervical collars while driving. - Not only should the driver wear seat belts, but passengers should also wear them to minimise the impact of sudden jolts from potholes. - Drivers should avoid excessive speed and sudden braking. - People with joint issues should be cautious as uneven roads can exacerbate spinal problems. In addition to back pain, there has also been an increase in complaints of leg pain, particularly in the left leg, due to frequent use of the clutch by car drivers.

We are calling for an affidavit that must be filed by the officer who has given this advice for filing of this Special Leave Petition,” the bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Prasanna B Varale reportedly said in its order. Back in 2000, Solanki had filed a writ petition claiming that he had worked as a part-time sweeper in the office of the Industries Commissioner, Bhavnagar, since Aug 1, 1983. He claimed that his requests for regularisation had not been addressed despite numerous representations. This went against a resolution dated December 11, 1984, which mandated the regularisation of part-time sweepers after 10 years of service, he had asserted. On Aug 14, the Supreme Court justices expressed disappointment that the state had chosen protracted litigation instead of complying with the HC order. “We want to know specifically as to which officer has advised filing of this special leave petition (SLP) against the decisions of the High Court,” the legal news website Bar and Bench quoted Justice Nath as saying. The court also stated that costs could be recovered from those responsible for unnecessarily prolonging the case. Notably, the apex court fined the Tamil Nadu government ₹1 lakh in Dec 2022 for stretching out a similar case.",ahmedabad
Shanti Asiatic School fined for failing to report fire incident,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/shanti-asiatic-school-fined-for-failing-to-report-fire-incident,2024-08-15,15,08,2024,"Following the controversial fire incident, Shanti Asiatic School has been fined ₹10,000 by the District Education Officer (DEO) for failing to report the incident as per the Right to Education (RTE) Act. Since the school is affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the DEO and District Primary Education Officer (DPO) have recommended a ₹5 lakh fine to CBSE for further action, which means CBSE might impose a substantial fine on the school. Although the current fine is ₹10,000, a letter has been sent to CBSE recommending an additional ₹5 lakh fine. The fire incident at Shanti Asiatic School, located on Sanand Road in Ahmedabad Rural, reportedly occurred last month due to a short circuit. The school did not report this incident to any authority, including DEO, DPO, or the corporation. As a result, when students informed their parents, many of them visited the school the next day, causing a commotion. Subsequently, the DEO and DPO teams, along with other officials including the taluka officer, corporation officers, and police, arrived at the school. The police also filed a complaint regarding the incident. Following the DEO's directive, the school conducted online classes until a fire safety audit was completed. The audit, carried out by the taluka officer's team and the corporation fire department, confirmed that offline classes could resume after the audit. However, a hearing process was initiated by the DEO and DPO. During the hearing, the school was asked to respond to various issues. The DEO imposed a ₹10,000 fine for failing to report the incident, while the DEO and DPO jointly recommended a ₹5 lakh fine to CBSE for safety equipment and security issues under Section 8.1. Thus, CBSE might impose a ₹5 lakh fine on the school.

In Ahmedabad city, issues of illegal entry of luxury buses, unauthorized parking on public roads, vehicles operating without permits across the state, and school vans carrying children with CNG kits have come under scrutiny by the HC. The court singled out the Regional Transport Office (RTO), transport department, and police for their negligence in controlling illegal activities like luxury buses entering city limits, unauthorized parking, and vehicles operating without permits. To address the issue, the court has ordered the RTO and transport department to submit a detailed action plan within four weeks. Justice Sandeep N Bhatt expressed distress over the complete failure of the system, highlighting that the public is suffering greatly and is in a state of desperation. The court remarked, “You will only act when a distressed person resorts to a revolt? You are supposed to serve the public, but your actions suggest otherwise. The RTO office should ensure adherence to laws and regulations.” The court criticized the RTO, the Additional Commissioner of the Transport Department, and the Under Secretary of the Home Department, saying, “What’s going on with your RTO? Transfers of vehicles take months. What provisions are there in the Motor Vehicle Act? Who is considered the owner of a vehicle? If someone sells their vehicle and you delay the transfer for months, who is responsible? It seems you need an agent for everything to get done. Why should the common public suffer?” The court further questioned the RTO’s office, “Are you running the office for the public or for agents? Is it to benefit the staff economically? If the system is online, why does work not get done on the same day?” “Licenses, transfers, or renewals are delayed for days with excuses like slow servers or staff vacations. But if an agent is involved, the work is completed by the evening. Your criteria change based on whether there is an agent involved. You need to improve the system, or the High Court will detail everything in its order,” the court added. Justice Bhatt also expressed profound dissatisfaction with the state of affairs, stating, “The system is completely broken and operates in darkness. Your offices are so inefficient that driving tracks are not functional, licenses are not issued on time, permits are not checked, and people’s issues are ignored. The media reports highlight these issues. Rickshaws are often overloaded, and school vans are dangerously packed with children”. The court also criticized the police department, noting, “The police and traffic department have nothing to say. Even though everything is visible, no action is taken. Private cars are used to carry passengers, while luxury buses, ST buses, and vendors occupy the roads, leaving no path for the public. The police should use their authority effectively and perform their duties.” Also read : Frequent glitches in RTO server causing financial losses to two-wheeler dealers",ahmedabad

An investigation revealed that 39 candidates were fraudulently given passing marks. The long delay after complaints first emerged in 2018, prompted GTU to finally take action by forming an investigative committee earlier this year. The committee, consisting of three professors, reviewed the case and submitted its findings, which were presented to the GTU Board of Governors on August 16. The report indicates that marks for 39 candidates were manipulated to ensure their success, despite their actual performance not meeting the passing criteria. Despite the clear evidence of fraud, GTU is yet to file a police complaint. Instead, the university has decided to issue a show-cause notice to Keyur Shah, the IT section head. Shah will be given 15 days to respond to the notice. His response will be reviewed in the next Board meeting, and further action taken . The scandal first came to light in 2018 when discrepancies in marks for some candidates were reported. Initial complaints indicated that marks for two teachers from government schools were tampered with. Although evidence was presented to the then-in-charge registrar, no investigation was initiated at that time. The case was dismissed as a technical error. However, following additional complaints and media coverage, GTU formed an investigation committee to address the issue. The committee found further evidence of tampering affecting 37 more candidates. Following the show cause notice to Keyur Shah the university will also address issues relating to Shah’s MCA degree from Karnataka University, which has been deemed invalid. At present, the investigation is ongoing, focusing on the roles of the IT section head, the exam coordinator, and the data entry operator. No legal action has been taken yet, but it will follow a thorough investigation into the extent of the irregularities. Also read : 34 students punished in GTU mass cheating case",ahmedabad

The agency responsible for this task will be paid ₹8 per tree counted. The last tree census was conducted in 2012, when the city had 6,18,000 trees, and the green cover area was 4.66%. To carry out the Geographic Information System (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS)-based tree census across the city’s seven zones, the AMC’s Garden Department issued a Request for Proposal (RFP). During the bidding, SAAR IT Resources Pvt  Ltd emerged as the lowest bidder and was assigned the task. Committee Chairperson Jayesh Trivedi said, “A six-month timeline has been set for the tree census. The survey will include the species of each tree, the diameter of its trunk, its exact latitude and longitude, its medicinal uses, and any unique characteristics.” Each tree will be given a unique number, and detailed information will be collected for rare species. Jignesh Patel, director of Parks and Gardens at the AMC, stated that the current green cover area in Ahmedabad is approximately 12%, but the exact number of trees will only be known after the census. Six months ago, the Garden Department had submitted a report to the corporation stating that in the last four years, around 55 lakh saplings and trees were planted in the city.

At the centre of the controversy is Amit Panchal, an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) worker and resident of the 40-year-old Dev Mandir Society in Chandlodiya. Panchal submitted a plan to demolish his house and construct a new one; and the AMC’s Building Plan Scrutiny Department (BPSD) approved the plan. However, Deputy Mayor Patel and town planning committee chairperson Pritesh Mehta were allegedly not consulted on the issue. When the two arrived at the BPSD’s Mithakhali office and found TPO Rajesh Patel absent, they questioned other officials, demanding to know how Panchal’s plan was approved without their nod. When TPO Patel arrived at the scene, a heated verbal exchange followed. Thereafter, Patel submitted his resignation to Municipal Commissioner M Thennarasan. While the deputy mayor has admitted to using abusive language, he added that he had “controlled himself” due to Mehta’s presence. ‘Discrepancies and irregularities’ Jatin Patel highlighted discrepancies in the application, noting the property card showed a built-up area of 69.3 square metres, while the applicant claimed 189 square metres. He also pointed out inconsistencies in the approval process and boundary assessments. He further emphasised that the society opposed the plan approval, alleging the applicant had encroached on society land. He told Gujarat Samachar that he had first written to the Commissioner on May 13, enquiring if plans could even be approved based on photocopies, but received no response. The approval granted to Panchal’s plan was revoked after the argument, which took place on Aug 6. Who is Rajesh Patel? Notably, Rajesh Patel is employed on contract following his retirement. He previously quit his role as town-planning officer with the town planning and estate management department in 2022, around the time the state government announced a new impact fee scheme. One of several senior officials to have resigned citing work pressure as a reason, his TPO’s resignation in 2022 left four of five TPO positions in the AMC vacant. Persons close to the development say Commissioner Thennarasan is yet to accept Patel’s resignation over the argument with the deputy mayor.

Moreover, special permission will be required for the Ganesh idol immersion procession. This requirement of providing names of influential local individuals during the permission process has caused confusion among the organisers. The Ganesh festival will be celebrated at various locations in Ahmedabad between Sept 7 and Nov 17. Permissions for the installation of Ganesh idols will be granted by the local police stations, and separate permissions will be needed for the immersion procession. However, if the procession is to pass through more than one zone, special permission will have to be obtained from the Special Branch. While this process is standard as per regulations, Ajaykumar Chaudhary, Joint Commissioner of Police (Special Branch), has specified that the organisers must submit the names of 15 to 20 influential people in their area along with the permission application at the local police station. This unusual decision by the police has left organisers in a dilemma.",ahmedabad

The accused also forged documents to assure the complainant of the legitimacy of their dealings. The complaint was filed with the Economics Offences Wing by Pankaj Patil, a resident of Ahmedabad’s Odhav, who owns the labour contract company along with his father. In August 2022, Patil was introduced to Sivamurthy Rajappa and his brother Srinivasa Rajappa of Karnataka, working as labour contract workers in Karnataka. The brothers told Pankaj that RIB Infrastructure needs labour in a road project in Solapur. Another project by Larsen & Toubro in Vijaywada was also promised by the accused. For multiple costs stated by the accused, Patil paid ₹1.16 cr to the accused. Following that with some other payments, Patil paid a total amount of ₹1.84 crore to the accused. Patil was also shown fake documents through email for assurance, along with a fake licence to operate from the National Highway Authority of India. When no business came to him, Patil grew suspicious and contacted IRB’s Mumbai office, where he came to know that the documents shown to him were forged. Patil, then unable to locate the brothers at their home, filed a complaint at the Economic Offences Wing. Also read: Gujarat gang busted in nationwide bank account scam worth ₹12 crore",ahmedabad

The 24-hour strike was part of the nationwide protest against the rape and murder of a postgraduate trainee doctor at Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug 9. Patients affected Government hospitals also witnessed a more than 40% reduction in OPD services and surgeries, as junior doctors joined in the protest. Services were severely curtailed at the Civil Hospital in Asarwa, which typically handles around 2,200 OPD consultations on Saturdays. Hospital Superintendent Dr Rakesh Joshi reported that only 22 surgeries were performed on the day of the strike, compared to the usual 40. Similarly, Civil Hospital at Sola saw 700 surgeries cancelled. Emergency services continued to operate, with 3,000 people receiving urgent care during the day. However, hundreds of patients with viral infections and mosquito-borne diseases were forced to self-medicate due to the unavailability of OPD services. Safety for docs Dr Mukesh Maheshwari, vice president of the Ahmedabad Medical Association, stated that over 1,000 doctors participated in a morning rally, carrying banners demanding justice. In the evening, more than 600 doctors joined a candlelight march. In response to the Kolkata incident, the Gujarat branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has demanded a security bill for doctors. Meanwhile, Dr Joshi of the Civil Hospital outlined several security measures being implemented at the Medicity campus in Asarwa. “Lighting has been increased throughout the hospital premises. The canteen opposite the old trauma centre, which was frequented by miscreants, has been closed. Local and police patrolling has been increased. Access to the trauma centre and ICU will be restricted, and additional family members will not be allowed,” he said. Police “She Teams” will be deployed near the postgraduate hostel at night, and they will accompany female doctors during emergencies.  Additional speed breakers have been installed to ensure that anyone attempting to flee after an incident can be apprehended, he added. With services in private hospitals set to resume on Aug 18, OPDs are expected to see long queues as patients seek delayed care. The strike has underscored the urgent need for improved security measures for healthcare workers across the country.

The Ahmedabad Cyber Crime unit arrested a suspect and discovered connections to the Munna Ansari gang from Uttar Pradesh. An additional suspect, identified as a sharpshooter from Munna Ansari’s gang, was also revealed. Cyber Crime officials have launched further investigations into the case. The Ahmedabad Cyber Crime unit initiated an investigation after detaining an individual from Azamgarh, UP. The fraud involved the gang transferring funds to various bank accounts. The perpetrators targeted the Neva Export Company’s account at Kalupur Co-operative Bank in Ahmedabad. They deactivated a registered mobile number and used net banking to carry out eight transactions in a single day, embezzling ₹2.29 crore. During the investigation, it was discovered that ₹3 lakh was transferred to an ICICI Bank account under the name of Saurabh Yadav. Based on this information, the police arrested Yadav. He revealed that he had been imprisoned in Azamgarh in 2021 and met Karthik Singh Durgapratap Singh while in jail. After his release, Yadav was contacted by Singh, who needed a bank account for transferring funds related to the sale of his house. Yadav opened an ICICI Bank account in his name and provided the debit card and checkbook to Singh’s associate Sonu. Singh and his team then used this account for fraudulent transactions. Following this lead, the police arrested the suspect from Azamgarh and discovered the involvement of Munna Ansari’s gang in the fraud. The gang’s scheme involved hacking company emails to obtain net banking passwords. They sent malware to the company’s email accounts, hacked them, and falsely claimed that the SIM card was lost to have it deactivated. After deactivating the SIM card, they accessed the company's bank account to conduct fraudulent transactions. The gang typically executed these frauds on weekends to avoid OTPs or messages reaching the deactivated SIM card, preventing the company directors from quickly issuing a new SIM card.",ahmedabad

In a recent contempt petition hearing, the court expressed frustration over the lack of tangible improvements despite numerous affidavits and grand claims of action. The bench, consisting of Justices A Y Kogje and Sameer Dave, highlighted the stark contrast between the elaborate claims made in affidavits by the authorities and the actual situation on the ground. They criticized the ineffective responses and failure to implement meaningful changes, stating that “Your demonstrated lack of willpower is evident.”The court emphasized that these issues were not limited to Ahmedabad but were widespread problems affecting the entire state. Justice Kogje and Justice Dave further criticized the government, traffic police, AMC, and other authorities for their ineffective responses and failure to implement meaningful changes. They noted that while the authorities were filling out paperwork and making promises, there was no real action being taken.

Blaming citizens for department’s failure is not acceptable Advocate Panchal also pointed out that the traffic department’s joint commissioner presented an affidavit claiming public cooperation for adhering to traffic rules. However, Panchal argued that enforcing these rules is the department’s responsibility, and blaming the public for the department’s failures is unacceptable. The court reiterated that despite the traffic police’s claims, the ground reality showed no significant change, and the situation remained unchanged.

Despite multiple requests for their presence, the AAG was not available, leading the court to take serious note of the situation.

The court made it clear that no leniency will be tolerated, and decisive action is required, or no resolution will be achieved. The court said that it has taken up numerous issues, and it is serious about the entire matter. Therefore, there will be no leniency. The court has been observing the situation since the last six hearings but has seen no satisfactory progress. Hence, it has become necessary for the above mentioned senior officials to provide answers in court. Despite 60 orders since 2018 in contempt cases, there has been no fruitful outcome. Justice bench emphasised that all the government’s claims and statements have been merely on paper. The court stressed that the government and its officials must genuinely implement the High Court’s orders. The police and municipal authorities must act decisively, or no resolution will be achieved, said HC.

Environmentalists are outraged by this move from Amdavad Municipal Corporation. On one hand, Prime Minister Modi and Union minister Amit Shah appeal to the public to plant trees under the ‘One Tree in the Name of Mother’ campaign, while on the other hand, the AMC just cuts down trees for infrastructure development. Fifteen days ago, more than 250 trees were flourishing in the area. With the announcement of a new bridge connecting Makarba to Karnavati Club, markings for tree cutting were made. The cutting was done swiftly to avoid further complications in the project. Nearly 200 trees have been cut down and removed, leaving many residents astonished. The remaining trees are also expected to be cut down soon. Ahmedabad has a total of 719 registered green buildings, with the highest number located on SG Highway and surrounding areas. Other areas with green buildings include Ambawadi, Navrangpura, Vastrapur, and Science City. According to recent data from the corporation, most green buildings are located in the areas where large green trees have been removed already. Locals question whether development can occur without cutting down the trees. Residents have noted that Makarba to Iskcon bridge road, which has heavy traffic and numerous registered green buildings, includes offices that had paid a premium amount for greenery. However, the situation has now changed with decades-old trees being destroyed. While the government promotes the concept of green buildings, it simultaneously destroys the trees along the roads leading to these green buildings.

This ill-planned organisation by the university resulted in more than 50% of the students not being able to participate in the tournament, causing significant losses to them.

Vijay Patel from the AMC’s water department told Gujarat Samachar that catchpits and manholes are cleaned from April to June each year. Additional cleaning is carried out during the monsoon as required, he said. This year, AMC claimed to have cleaned 63,000 catchpits in three rounds. However, the city was left floundering after receiving more than 3 inches of rain in the 24 hours ending 6 am on Aug 26. Eight underpasses were closed on Aug 26 due to waterlogging: 1. Akhbar Nagar 2. Mithakali 3. Usmanpura 4. Sayona, Chandlodiya 5. Parimal 6. Makarba 7. Shahibaug 8. Dakshini, Maninagar Dakshini and Sayona were not reopened until the afternoon of Aug 27. Meanwhile, the Vaishno Devi-Zundal underpass turned into a “waterfall” with rainwater pouring out of crevices, according to videos on social media. As of Aug 28, officials say it will likely remain shut for two–three days. All of which begs the question, what exactly did AMC’s ₹35 crore expenditure cover?

In the writ petition filed by the students of D T Law College, Advocate Bhunesh Rupere argued that the petitioners had completed their graduation from Navgujarat Campus affiliated with Gujarat University and subsequently enrolled in D T Law College for their LLB degree. After completing the three-year LLB course, the petitioners applied for a provisional certificate from the Gujarat Bar Council. However, they were not issued the certificate because it was revealed that D T Law College had not received BCI recognition since 2011 and had not paid the necessary fees for it. Consequently, the lack of BCI recognition has delayed the issuance of provisional certificates for the students. Without these certificates, the petitioners are unable to gain provisional practice or experience as lawyers. In the hearing, Justice Sangeeta Vishen issued notices to the state's Law Secretary, Gujarat University, the Bar Council of India, the Bar Council of Gujarat, and the principal of D T Law College, demanding their responses. Justice Hasmukh Kella, former Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Gujarat Bar Council, stated that due to the lack of BCI recognition, there are around a thousand provisional certificate applications pending. The law colleges are required to obtain BCI recognition and must pay an annual inspection fee. After paying the fee, BCI conducts an inspection and verification before granting recognition. However, more than 28 law colleges in the state do not have BCI recognition, which has led to the backlog of provisional certificate applications for students.

He also suggested that since a single corporator might not be able to cover an entire ward, an official should be assigned to each waterlogged spot within every ward to ensure thorough reporting. The meeting comes on the heels of instructions from Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel directing officials in Ahmedabad to review the post-rain situation.

Science City to lose green cover: Over 400 trees set for chopping,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/science-city-to-lose-green-cover-over-400-trees-set-for-chopping,2024-09-01,1,09,2024,"Over 400 fully matured, decade-old trees along Science City Road are now at risk of being cut down due to the planned construction of a Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) track. The Science City area of Ahmedabad, considered one of the most environmentally sensitive and greenest areas, is now facing the possibility of losing these trees as the road is being developed to resemble C G Road. Ten years ago, past the Sola Bridge, there was a single-lane road in this area. With the inclusion of the Science City area in the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and increasing traffic issues, the road was widened. Along with the road widening, trees were planted, including Tabebuia rosea, also called pink poui, Saptaparni, two large banyan trees, numerous neem trees, Gulmohar, and bougainvillaea trees. Due to the frequent visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other politicians, these trees were well-maintained. However, now, with a budget of ₹30 crores, this road is being further developed, which includes the construction of footpaths and seating areas. A BRTS track is also being planned, leading to the inevitable cutting down of more than 400 well-developed trees. According to reports, to minimise public concern over tree conservation, the tree-cutting work is being conducted at night to avoid drawing significant attention. Once these large trees, stretching from the Bahuchar Mata Temple to Kesar SAL Medical College, are cut down, a significant green cover in the area will be lost. The government has established nine different gardens in the Science City area to demonstrate the importance of the environment. These include the large Sardar Patel Garden and two oxygen parks. However, the locals are concerned that as soon as the current road development work is completed, these trees will be cut down to make way for the BRTS track. Already, more than 50 trees have been cut down to build three BRTS stands. Local authorities argue that with the increasing traffic in the area, the roads are narrow, and the BRTS track is necessary for convenience. On the other hand, the locals question why such a significant green cover was created by planting so many trees if the government’s plan always included constructing a BRTS track in this area.

AMC’s vague take on expenditure on pothole repairs,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/amcs-vague-take-on-expenditure-on-pothole-repairs,2024-09-01,1,09,2024,"The road network in Ahmedabad spanning 2,635 km has been riddled with a total of 55,000 potholes over the last three years after the monsoon, according to Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC). Even with one month left in this year’s monsoon season, these sources acknowledged that 19,000 potholes were formed on Ahmedabad roads this year. However, when asked about the amount required by the AMC to fill the  potholes this year, officials, chairpersons, and members of the Standing Committee stated that they did not have an amount since the expenses are calculated on a zone-wise basis. 6,000 potholes AMC  officials, aiming to conceal the expenses incurred in filling the potholes, claim that the zone-wise expenses are calculated separately, and determining the exact amount will take time as precise calculations are needed. The chairperson of the Road Committee mentioned that over 6,000 potholes were filled between Aug 23 and 31. The Road Committee of the AMC is responsible for approving proposals related to the construction of new roads, resurfacing old roads, and filling potholes in the city. When asked about the approximate cost incurred in filling the 19,626 potholes on various roads in the city this year, Road Committee Chairman Jayesh Patel said, “Since the work is done zone-wise, it is difficult to obtain the exact cost of filling the potholes at the moment.” Apart from the rain, the work of various agencies is also responsible for the potholes The road network within the jurisdiction of the AMC totals 2,635 km. Every year, roads spanning 800 to 1,000 km are dug up by utility cable agencies, gas agencies, and other agencies for laying or upgrading cables and for fault repairs. Additionally, the AMC itself digs up roads for laying or upgrading sewer and water lines or stormwater drains. However, after the work is completed by these agencies, proper supervision of the refilling work at the zone level does not occur as it should. Annually, a total of ₹1,000 crore is spent from the budget on the city's extensive road network. Out of this budget, only ₹400 crore, or 40%, is used for new road construction. The remaining ₹200 crore are allocated for resurfacing (repairs, post-grinding maintenance, or filling monsoon potholes), and ₹250 crore come as a grant from the state government. The majority of this grant is allocated to filling potholes that emerge during the monsoon season, particularly following the declaration that all potholes will be addressed before Diwali. However, the specific expenditure on filling each pothole remains unclear. Also read: Ahmedabad riddled with 19,000 potholes after rains wash away roads",ahmedabad

As per police sources, the incident happened around 2.40 pm near Subhash Bridge on the Sabarmati Riverfront. The reason for taking the extreme step is not known. According to Bilal Ansari, a 21-year-old painter and witness, he and his friends were sitting nearby when they noticed a girl who was conversing on the phone for quite some time before dropping her phone and bag on a bench and jumping into the river.

However, Bhumi did not catch it and instead moved in the opposite direction before drowning. The Riverfront police and fire department personnel promptly arrived after being called by passersby and started a rescue operation. They were able to recover her body after around half-an-hour of search, following which she was declared dead. The police identified the deceased as Bhumi Vaghela, 19,  from the documents found in her bag. Her relatives were contacted from her phone lying next to her bag. The initial investigation has revealed that Bhumi was a resident of Sabarmati and worked as a nurse at a multispeciality hospital in Nirnaynagar. The police is further probing the matter. Riverfront fire officer Bharat Mangela said that the recovery was not very complicated as they knew the exact location where she had jumped.

The SMC officials established that this liquor consignment was being transported from Rajasthan to a bootlegger in the city’s Satellite area. Acting on a tip-off, the SMC set up a trap near Sola Bhagwat and spotted a black, numberless SUV. However, when the suspected vehicle was signalled to stop, the accused attempted to flee. This followed a high-speed chase, which ended with the authorities successfully intercepting the SUV and apprehending the two occupants. Upon interrogation, the driver, Rupram Jat from Bikaner, Rajasthan, confessed that the liquor was supplied by Pawan Giri ‘Maharaj’ from Barmer and was to be handed over to a bootlegger in Satellite. He was accompanied in this delivery by Jasraj Jat, also a resident of Barmer. Rupram further revealed that he was involved in the liquor smuggling business to earn money. He had previously made five liquor deliveries in Gujarat, thrice in Ahmedabad and twice in Vadodara.

The tailor, who also operated an embroidery business in Ahmedabad’s Odhav area, hanged himself using a dupatta on the afternoon of September 2. Krunal Desai, Assistant Commissioner of Police of I Division, told Gujarat Samachar Digital that Parmar’s widow Neelam had filed a complaint stating that Yogesh Shah and Pramod Shah had been harassing Parmar over a debt. Police are investigating further. Neelam told the police that her husband had been terrified of Yogesh and Pramod, his friends who had lent him ₹1 lakh and ₹3 lakh, respectively. He had needed the money three years ago, to meet medical expenses for his late parents: a kidney patient and a paralytic. Parmar managed to keep up with his payments—both interest and EMIs—to his friends until three months ago. When he missed one payment, his friends began to abuse him verbally and physically, even in public. Neelam told the police that her husband had been deeply traumatised by the humiliation he endured at the hands of his so-called friends. Parmar killed himself in their rented home, while Neelam and her eight-year-old son had gone out. When she returned, and Parmar failed to respond to her calls or open the door, she had the door broken and discovered his body.

We must enrol 66 lakh female members in Gujarat: C R Patil,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/we-must-enrol-66-lakh-female-members-in-gujarat-bhupendra-patel-cr-patil,2024-09-03,3,09,2024,"C R Patil Gujarat BJP today urged the party workers to aim for 66 lakh female members for the party in the state. “Women hold an important place in our party. In light of the 33% reservation for women, our aim must be to enrol approximately 66 lakh female members in our party,” Gujarat BJP chief C R Patil said while inaugurating the Gujarat leg of the party’s membership drive. Patil handed over the first membership to Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel during an event at the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Auditorium in Ahmedabad. The Chief Minister expressed “pride in being part of the BJP,” noting that the BJP is the only party where an ordinary worker can rise to become the Prime Minister for three consecutive terms. On Sept 2, BJP launched its membership campaign in New Delhi, beginning a nationwide effort to bolster the party’s ranks. Patil said that the party has set a target of two crore members from the state. “In the previous membership drive, we had 1.19 crore members, and in the recent elections, we secured 1.88 crore votes. If the election had included Surat, we would have added eight lakh more votes, bringing our total to 1.96 crore for the Lok Sabha elections,” he said. He added that to put this in perspective, the BJP received 1.87 crore votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, 1.73 crore votes in the 2022 assembly polls, and this time the party reached 1.96 crore votes. “There’s some pessimism after the Lok Sabha poll results because we secured fewer seats. However, as Home Minister Amit Shah has pointed out, if we had won 241 seats in 2014, we would have celebrated with crackers. In Gujarat, I take responsibility for losing one seat, but now we must focus on moving forward,” he said.

Italia’s bold allegations Italia took pot shots at Gujarat minister Harsh Sanghavi after he received a notification sanctioning his promotion from constable to head constable despite letting off the job in 2015. Italia took to social media platform X, displaying a major lapse in the department’s operations. In a mocking jibe at Sanghavi, the minister of state for home affairs, Italia said, “I am grateful to the Home Minister Harsh Sanghavi for promoting me to the rank of Head Constable and including my name at number 726 in this year’s Constable promotion list even though I left my job in the Gujarat Police in 2015.” Ahmedabad police responds Responding to these claims, Ahmedabad police posted on X, “Recently, 137 Head Constables in Ahmedabad were promoted to the rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI), and directions were issued to fill the vacancies immediately by promoting police constables to head constables. “Therefore, to facilitate these promotions, details were sought based on a prevailing list of 887 names, which is a routine part of the promotion process. A circular was issued asking for information within 48 hours regarding whether departmental inquiries or cases were pending against these employees for promotion. “This list included the names of all police constables who had joined the department up to Jan 11, 2012. Since Gopal Italia joined the police force in 2012, his name was included in the list. However, no police station is mentioned against his name, which clearly indicates that Gopal Italia has not been promoted to the rank of Head Constable. The messages circulating on social media are false and baseless.

Today, the students adopted ‘silent protest’ by wearing masks on their faces, symbolising the government’s efforts to silence their voices. What led to the strike? Clearing the air, Shashank Asara, Vice President of the Junior Doctors Association at Civil Hospital, “There was a negotiation with Rushikesh Patel regarding a 30% stipend increase, which he had noted in his diary, and we were assured it would happen. However, when the decision came through, it was only a 20% increase, which is unacceptable. Now, they are deploying police to deal with us.” He informed Gujarat Samachar Digital, “In the morning, we were warned by the police that if we didn’t stop the strike, they would be forced to take strict action against us. A force of 100 police officers was deployed on campus, and even the electricity was cut off.” JD Zala, Shahibaug Police Inspector, stated, “Right now, we have deployed 100 police officers in the field to monitor the situation. As long as the silent protest remains peaceful, we are fine with it.” All that the 1,300 resident doctors and intern doctors are demanding is a 40% increase in their stipends and a regular raise every three years.

Valia in Bharuch district recorded the highest rainfall, receiving 11.69 inches. Talukas of Surat, Valsad, and Kutch also received significant rainfall with rainfall ranging between 3.94 inches to 2.56 inches. Due to flooding on the causeway connecting Daulatpur village, the roads were closed for the traffic. Moreover, roads in Sodgam were also submerged, leading to a complete shutdown of vehicular movement. The low-lying areas in Valia were put on alert, and schools in the Bharuch district were declared closed. Heavy rains in the upper regions have caused a significant inflow of fresh water into the rivers, leading to flooding in the areas of Desad and Sodgam. The rivers Vankhadi and Kim have overflowed, surrounding these regions with water. On the other hand, the downpour in Bharuch district resulted in 5 inches of rain in just two hours on Sept 2, and 7.6 inches in the past 24 hours, leading to waterlogging in several areas of the city. The overflowing of several drains forced road closures, leading to long traffic jams on many roads, with people getting stuck in the gridlock. At Sevashram Road, Panch Batti, Dandiya Bazaar, Kasak Circle, Gandhi Bazaar, Fata Talav, and others, water reached waist-deep levels. Rainwater also flooded the Indira Nagar slum and several societies in Bharuch, with water entering homes and vehicles. Many shops were also flooded, causing great inconvenience to traders. With public life thrown into disarray, the railway tracks near Shaktinath and the road leading from the collector’s office to the Civil Hospital had to be closed to traffic due to flooding. This resulted in long queues of vehicles on these roads, causing massive traffic jams. હાલમાં ભરૂચ જિલ્લાના વાલીયા તાલુકામાં પડેલા ૧૮ ઇંચ વરસાદને પગલે હાંસોટ તાલુકાના પાંજરોલી, ઓભા, આસરસા, ઈલાવ અને બાલોતા ગામમાં કીમ નદીની સપાટી વધી શકે છે. ગ્રામજનોને સચેત રહેવા અને સ્થળાંતરની જરૂર જણાય તંત્રને સહકાર આપવા વિનંતી છે. @CMOGuj @InfoGujarat — Collector & DM Bharuch (@CollectorBharch) September 3, 2024 Also read: Rain returns to Gujarat, 36 districts including Ahmedabad witness showers",ahmedabad

With a rural court remanding Thakkar to custody for four days on Sep 2, the State Monitoring Cell (SMC) has renewed hope of uncovering crucial evidence against Harshit Jain, the alleged mastermind behind the operation. In his primary interrogation, Thakkar said Jain, who is currently on the run, moved the substantial proceeds of the operation through hawala channels from Gujarat to Dubai in return for a hefty commission. Amit Majethiya, accused of operating the country’s largest cricket-betting operation from Dubai, also considered Jain a key associate. However, the SMC of the Gujarat police is yet to find concrete evidence against Jain. In addition to Jain, Thakkar and Majethiya, bookie Saurabh (alias Mahadev), and one Bharat Thakkar are believed to be the key players in the illegal betting and trading network based out of Ahmedabad’s Madhavpura area. Deepak Thakkar is the only one of the five to have been apprehended so far. The others are all absconding. What we know so far Thakkar’s arrest came after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) issued a Red-Corner Notice—a request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action. Investigators have so far uncovered several details of the operation: Velocity Server: Thakkar allegedly obtained a velocity server from Samir, also known as Sam Nepali, in Dubai. Further investigation is ongoing to gather related electronic evidence. Seized Electronics: Authorities seized an all-in-one computer, laptop, and mobile phone from Thakkar. These devices revealed details of financial transactions worth crores of rupees under different IDs related to illegal betting activities. Bank Account Discovery: The investigation uncovered a bank account named “ND Traders”, opened by Naresh Dayaram Bhai Thakor, who works for Thakkar. This account was used for share market dabba trading transactions. Further Investigation: Due to the involvement of this bank account in illegal activities, it requires further investigation along with Thakkar. Angadia Transactions: Thakkar allegedly conducted transactions worth over ₹43.32 lakh through PM Angadia and HM Angadia companies. Financial Manipulation: The financial transactions and Thakkar's involvement will be scrutinised for potential financial manipulation and money laundering. Thakkar is expected to be interrogated further, by other agencies, once his four-day remand ends. Also read: Madhavpura betting scam: Most wanted accused Deepak Thakkar arrested in Dubai",ahmedabad

The Economic Offenses Wing launched an investigation after receiving the complaint. Following a thorough probe, they identified the perpetrators and arrested them. The accused were remanded to judicial custody for seven days. Further investigation into the matter is underway. Also read : Three arrested for ₹1.61 crore investment scam in Ahmedabad",ahmedabad
Junior doctors in Ahmedabad end strike after meeting with CM,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/junior-doctors-in-ahmedabad-end-strike-after-meeting-with-cm,2024-09-04,4,09,2024,"Junior doctors-interns meet CM Bhupendra Patel The junior doctors and interns of Ahmedabad Civil Hospital’s BJ Medical campus have finally ended the strike demanding a 40% stipend instead of 20%. The strike was concluded after the doctors’ meeting with Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, who is likely to have assured the protesting doctors of a solution in the future. Three years after completing their postgraduate (PG) and passing the exams, senior resident doctors are required to do one year of duty. As this academic year is coming to an end, senior residents were also facing the threat of termination if the strike would have continued. The two-day-long strike On Sept 2, BJ Medical College issued a notice to interns, PG students, and residents, ordering them to report for duty at 9 am on Sept 3. It was also mentioned that if they failed to comply, strict action would be taken and the police would be informed. Around 100 police personnel were present at the campus on Sept 3 while the resident doctors were holding a ‘silent protest’ using masks to cover their mouths. When the junior doctors went on strike on Sept 2, demanding a 40% hike in stipends instead of 20%, the government claimed that the junior doctors in the state are provided higher stipends than other states and, that it is inhumane to go on a strike at the expense of patient care, and the act of using it as a threat is completely unacceptable. Moreover, the stipend for interns and resident doctors in Gujarat is entirely tax-free, according to the government.

Despite the rains having stopped, the housing scheme continues to be waterlogged, causing immense inconvenience and suffering to the residents. The situation is ignored by the municipal corporation and has failed to implement effective solutions. On September 4, MLA Babu Patel, Water Committee Chairman Dilip Bagriya, and local corporators visited the housing scheme. However, instead of offering concrete solutions for water drainage, Chairman Dilip Bagriya suggested that residents stay in rain shelters and assured them of food provisions at rain shelters . This insensitive remark further fueled the residents with anger and frustration . The residents demanded permanent solutions to the drainage problems and appealed to the corporation to either address the issue or provide them with alternative housing. They criticised the officials for coming to the area merely for photo opportunities and not taking their concerns seriously, for which the residents just asked the officials to leave. The Madhumalti Housing Scheme has been plagued by drainage issues for years, and the residents have long been demanding action from the municipal authorities. The recent visit by the officials has only served to highlight their apathy and incompetence. Also read : ₹2 crore hit on GSRTC in one week as torrential rains disrupt operations",ahmedabad
Ahmedabad medical shop install ‘medicine dropboxes’ to help underprivileged,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-medical-shop-install-medicine-dropboxes-to-help-underprivileged,2024-09-05,5,09,2024,"Have you ever encountered a medicine drop box? Well, a medical agency based in Ahmedabad has launched a social initiative where citizens can donate excess or leftover medicines across 31 medicine drop boxes installed in the city. Paras Medical has installed ‘medicine drop boxes’ across its 31 branches across the city and the collected medicines will be distributed to homeless and underprivileged individuals who cannot afford the cost of essential medications. Arpan Shah, the owner of Paras Medical’s  South Bopal branch, explained the inspiration behind this service, saying, “We’ve been doing this for the past five years. I used to work at my uncle’s medical shop a long time ago, where I saw many people unable to afford expensive medicines. They had no choice but to forgo treatment. I wanted to help those people, so when I opened my own shop, I initiated this service to assist them.” The drop boxes are seeing regular contributions, and Shah shared that in the South Bopal branch alone, around 10 to 15 people visit each month to receive medicines from the donated stock. These donations are making a significant impact on the lives of those who would otherwise struggle to obtain the medications they need. Get medical devices on rent The owner has also received donations of medical devices such as nebulisers and blood pressure monitors. He rents these out to those in need for a minimal fee of ₹200 per week. After the devices are returned, the rental fee is often refunded or donated to charity. “We started charging a deposit or rental fee because there were instances where people took the devices and never returned them,” Shah explained. “But whatever we collect goes to charity, so it’s all for a good cause.” Also read: Govt slashes prices of 41 medicines",ahmedabad

According to the commissioner, despite the completion of their approved leave, some employees have not resumed their work, and senior officials in the departments have not taken appropriate action. This has led to ongoing disputes between the corporation and the employees. To address this issue, the commissioner has instructed all Deputy Municipal Commissioners, Assistant Municipal Commissioners, and senior officials to urgently prepare a list of employees and officials who have been on foreign leave for the past three months and have not reported back to work. The commissioner has warned that strict action will be taken against all such employees and officials as per the guidelines of the Industrial Relations Department. This move is aimed at ensuring discipline and accountability among the municipal workforce. Before this, the Gujarat government had previously terminated 134 teachers for absenteeism, and  had initiated police action against three of them. Following complaints of numerous teacher absences in government schools across the state, the education department had directed all DEOs (District Education Officers) and DPOs (District Primary Education Officers) to act on it following that the government took disciplinary action against the teachers, resulting in their termination. Among the terminated teachers, police cases have been filed against one teacher each from Rajkot, Anand, and Kutch.

According to K T Kamaria, the Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP), the police have no authority to seize Thakkar’s properties, so they can gather all information about his assets and report it to the ED. In Dubai, there is a regulation that foreigners cannot purchase property in their names. Thus, there is a possibility that Thakkar collaborated with Dubai citizens to invest in large amounts of property. The police are also investigating Thakkar’s involvement in stock market investments. Earlier, it was revealed that along with his family members, he acquired properties worth ₹100 crore in Ahmedabad, Deesa, and Bhabhar with the ownership registered under their names.

AMC to spend ₹3.40 crore on in-house software development,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/amc-to-spend-3-40-crore-on-in-house-software-development,2024-09-06,6,09,2024,"The Standing Committee of AMC (Amdavad Municipal Corporation) has approved a proposal to develop multiple in-house software solutions for various municipal operations. A project manager for this project will be receiving a monthly salary of ₹3.61 lakh, which is significantly higher than the salary of an IAS officer appointed as an AMC officer. Despite having an e-governance department, the corporation has decided to hire an IT agency to provide manpower and develop software. The corporation argues that the in-house team will enable them to develop customised software solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of the city. They also claim that the long-term cost savings from having an in-house team will outweigh the initial investment. The agency, named ManekTech, will be contracted for five years at an annual cost of ₹3.40 crore. As per the reports the tendered amount for the project is ₹3.78 crore, whereas the agency will be paid only ₹3.40 which is 10% less than the tendered amount. The contracted agency will provide a staff of 18 employees, including a project manager, system analyst, and junior and senior programmers. There has been no certain response from officials regarding the benefits that the municipal corporation will gain from this in-house arrangement.

According to the current regulations set by the government, once the deadline for filing returns has passed, taxpayers are required to file their returns under the new tax regime. The doors for filing returns under the old tax regime are now closed after the deadline. This has caused significant inconvenience, especially for salaried employees who missed the deadline. The income tax portal faced technical issues during the last 15 days before the deadline, further complicating matters for taxpayers. In light of these challenges, many taxpayers are demanding an extension until December 31, 2024, to file their returns under the old tax regime. Under the new tax regime, taxpayers no longer receive deductions for various expenses such as those under Section 80C and house rent allowances. As a result, the tax burden on salaried individuals has increased considerably. Previously, under the old system, deductions were available, which helped reduce the taxable income. However, under the new system, such deductions are not available, and taxpayers are also required to pay interest and penalties.

7 stars for cleanliness? Ahmedabad’s goals seem far-fetched,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/7-stars-for-cleanliness-ahmedabad-s-goals-seem-far-fetched,2024-09-06,6,09,2024,"The Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) continues to grapple with persistent cleanliness issues, despite numerous admonitions from the Gujarat High Court. And, as sanitation woes mount, the city’s dream of achieving a 7-star rating under the Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0 seems to be slipping further away. In Swachh Survekshan 2023, the city applied for a 5-star certificate but secured only a 3-star rating. Since then, authorities say they have made progress. The Municipal Commissioner has been authorised to take necessary actions to ensure a 7-star rating. AMC claims to have cleared 44 acres of an 84-acre garbage dump in Pirana. It has invested ₹5,318 crore in door-to-door waste collection. It has also outsourced sanitation services. It even hired consultants—at a cost of ₹1.25 crore—to help make Ahmedabad the cleanest city by 2026. Yet, residents report irregular waste collection, and overflowing rubbish heaps can be seen in several areas, including near the river, bridges, and underpasses. The apparent disconnect between official claims and ground realities suggests that the AMC needs to reassess its strategies and implementation methods. Despite significant financial investments, achieving Ahmedabad’s ambitions of becoming a 7-star clean city remains a challenge. As the 2026 deadline approaches, the city’s ability to bridge this gap will be crucial in determining whether its cleanliness goals are achievable or truly far-fetched.

GTU student threatens examiner in answer sheet to pass him,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gtu-student-threatens-examiner-in-answer-sheet-to-pass-him,2024-09-07,7,09,2024,"‘Pass me in the examinations or I will.....’ an engineering student warned the examiner in his answer sheet to pass him. A third-semester diploma engineering student of the Gujarat Technological University (GTU) might face a level-4 penalty as the examiner found a written plea requesting the student be passed. What shocked officials was the inclusion of a direct threat, warning the teacher of harm if the student failed the exam. Level-4 penalty could lead to severe consequences, including the cancellation of all summer semester results and debarment from the next three semesters. A staggering 142 students were caught engaging in various forms of cheating during the recent summer semester exams, according to official reports. The students employed different tactics to gain an unfair advantage, including smuggling chits into the examination hall, tampering with answer books, and writing unauthorised notes within their answer sheets. The university administration has responded swiftly, imposing penalties based on the severity of each offence. Among the 142 cases, the penalties have been classified into four levels. One student has been handed a level-1 penalty, 23 students face a level-2 penalty, 60 students face a level-3 penalty, and one student has been slapped with a level-4 penalty—the most severe. GTU penalty classifications Level 1 (A to K): Declare the examinee as ‘Fail’ in the respective subject of the current semester examination. Level 2 (A to E): Cancel the result of all subjects of the current semester examination. Level 3 (A to N): Cancel the result of all subjects of the summer/winter examination and debar the examinee from appearing in future examinations. Level 4 (A to D): Cancel the result of all subjects of the current semester examination and debar the examinee from appearing in the next three summer/winter examinations. Level 5 (A to D): Cancel the result of all subjects of the current semester examination and debar the examinee from appearing in the next four summer/winter examinations. Level 6 (C): Defer the submission of thesis/dissertation/project work for 3 years (ME/M.Pharm/MBA/MCA) or 5 years (PhD). Resubmission must be with a new topic and fresh work. Level 7: The examination committee decides the penalty based on the nature and complexity of the examinee's involvement.

"‘Only paper work, no action’, Guj HC rebukes AMC for Sabarmati pollution",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/only-paper-work-no-action-guj-hc-rebukes-amc-for-sabarmati-pollution,2024-09-07,7,09,2024,"During the hearing of the suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) regarding pollution in the Sabarmati River, the Gujarat High Court on September 6 reprimanded the officials of the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC). The division bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Vaibhavi Nanavati, expressed severe displeasure after AMC failed to provide a concrete response regarding the cleaning of the Sabarmati River and the Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs). The court stated, “All your claims are on paper. Every time, AMC makes promises but does not follow through. It seems like you want to turn a long-term plan into a super long-term one for cleaning the Sabarmati River. In reality, you lack the will to work. If you had the will, your approach wouldn’t be so indifferent.” Monthly progress report During the hearing, the court demanded a monthly progress report from AMC. The corporation stated, “We have already submitted two reports, and the third report is included in today’s affidavit.” The court also questioned AMC about the STP upgrades, to which AMC responded, “We have taken steps regarding short-term solutions, including the initiation of two pumping stations.” Regarding the capacity of the 106 MLD treatment plant, the court noted, “As per the mid-term plan, the work is expected to be completed by February 2025. However, since the tender hasn’t been issued yet, how could you inform the court that the work would begin in June? The Standing Committee has yet to make a decision. Every time, you list your issues but fail to show any progress. If your STPs are not operating at full capacity and you’re diverting 35 MLD of water, what impact does that have? This untreated water flows into the river.” When AMC’s lawyers tried to discuss the project’s costs, the court interrupted, saying, “Don’t talk about costs; we are concerned about people’s lives. The progress made by AMC is unsatisfactory.” AMC claimed that the short-term plan for the old Pirana STP has been completed and that the plant is operating at 100% capacity. The court asked if the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had inspected the STP. Court assistant Hemang Shah pointed out that the STP's operations do not meet National Green Tribunal Act (NGT) norms. AMC also stated that illegal industrial connections have been removed. However, the court criticised AMC, noting that their Vasna STP is operating at half capacity. The court pointed out that new STPs are scheduled for 2026, 2027, and 2028, and AMC is currently diverting sewage effluent. “How can you claim to have a solution? Bypassing effluent is an ongoing issue for AMC,” the court remarked. The court further added, “Industrial effluent is discharged into domestic STPs, and every time, you complain and cry about it. This issue has persisted for the last four or five years. However, you neither create a blueprint nor commit to a solution. You always come up with excuses and try to evade the court. You lack the will. If you had the will, your approach would not be so indifferent.” AMC’s 100% claim The court questioned why AMC uses the phrase ‘100%’ in its affidavits when nothing is being implemented. “Every time you assure us with 100% in your affidavits, but nothing is being followed. Why do you write ‘100%’ when there’s no progress? From how you’re handling the case, it’s clear that you have no respect or regard for the court’s orders. You were supposed to take action, but you haven’t. The biggest issue is that you don’t accept your mistakes,” the court remarked, further warning AMC to be careful while filing affidavits, as oral instructions would not be accepted. The court questioned the status of tenders and work orders, asking why only three new STPs are being built and what will happen to the existing ones. AMC admitted, “We have failed in our responsibility”. The court concluded, “You have failed in all aspects. There is no progress, only a painted picture. You speak of long-term solutions, but where is the progress? You fail to understand what the court expects from AMC.” Also read: Gujarat HC slams AMC, GPCB over continued pollution in Sabarmati Gujarat HC rebukes AMC over Sabarmati pollution, STPs, waterlogging",ahmedabad

In 2018, the NOC presented by the builder of ‘Salman Avenue’ to the AMC was revealed to be bogus. The ASI submitted that no such NOC was issued in 2015, as claimed by the builder. The Gujarat High Court had provided two months to builder to obtain the NOC, ordering a ‘status quo’ after AMC had issued a notice of demolition. However, no NOC was obtained during those two months. Despite that, no action has been taken by the Estates and Legal Department of the AMC for last six years. Officials of the legal department were unable explain the inaction against the construction for six years despite the lack of NOC. The builder was required to acquire an NOC from the ASI since the construction site falls within 100 metres of a historical monument. Also read: 7 stars for cleanliness?

The micro tribe that migrated from Rajasthan during the Great Famine of 1856 learned to earn their livelihood with their god-gifted skill of sculpting the deities. With Ganesh Chaturthi just around the corner, the boari community of Gulbai Tekra are all geared up for the festivities that yield them maximum earnings for the year. “Bolo kevi murti joiye?” (Which type of idol do you want) asks Tannu as Gujarat Samachar Digital visits the place. The petite woman in Rajput attire has a peculiar boari identity – a golden nose ring that women of all ages wear in the basti. Baori community women of Gulbai Tekra When asked if all their idols will be sold, Tannu makes a witty remark, “Bhagwan to vechai j javana chhe ne!” (God will be sold, afterall!). “Almost 5,000 families here are involved in all kinds of art, but sculpting religious idols stayed with us and became our legacy. We make idols as per the festivals, Ganeshji on Ganesh Chaturthi, Laxmiji on Diwali, Mataji avatars in Navratri, and that is how we earn our livelihood,” says Dinesh Rathod, a singer, theatre artist and a sculptor. “Every family here has preserved the 200-year-old legacy of sculpting and painting, the main source of our livelihood,” says Dinesh. “From 2-inch to 12-feet, you’ll find the smallest and tallest idols in Gulbai Tekra. The community here sells 2 lakh to 2.5 lakh Ganpati idols approximately every year,” says Paresh Marwadi, community leader at Gulbai Tekra. Ganesha idol at Gulbai Tekra “I challenge that one of the best moulds of Ganesha idols across India would be from Gulbai Tekra,” says Paresh with a proud smirk. The idols from Gulbai Tekra are sent to Vapi, Surat, Valsad, and even Pune and Mumbai, according to Paresh. “The Gulbai Tekra artist community makes both eco-friendly and PoP (plaster of Paris) murtis. We have mostly shifted to eco-friendly murtis as our river Sabarmati is getting polluted by the day,” emphasises Paresh. According to the artists, eco-friendly murtis take 20 days, whereas 100 such PoP murtis can be made in the meantime. “Ram Lalla themed Ganesha murti is a trend this year!” said Paresh. Ram Lalla themed Ganesha idol in making The eyes have it all While men are busy in moulding and sculpting the murtis, women and children enjoy painting and detailing the finer aspects of the idols, informed Paresh. “There’s an interesting fact! Not every sculptor can make and paint the eyes of the murtis, that is why it is done after the whole murti is made, by a special artist for eyes painting in Gulbai Tekra,” says Paresh. Baori community woman and child painting Ganesha idol When asked how the prep was going, Laxman Parmar said with a satisfaction on his face, “We are preparing Bappa for thousands of homes.” According to him, one of the challenges to the business is fewer  customers and frequent rains. The heavy rains in Ahmedabad have destroyed many clay and eco-friendly idols. Morevoer, people were also reluctant to enter the waterlogged Gulbai Tekra area. Livelihood or legacy? “I have been making idols for the past 30 years. Our ancestors started this work decades ago. I do it for a living, but my son here is sculpting out of passion and continuing the legacy. He works 9 to 5 at a private firm and makes idols later which gives him peace,” says Laxman.

A complaint has been filed at the Ghatlodia police station in this regard. Vaishali Patel, a resident of Manichandra Society near Thaltej’s Surdhara Circle, lost her husband in 2018. In 2021, her family came across a significant sum of money following the sale of land by her father-in-law. Vaishali was looking for suitable investment opportunities to manage this sum effectively. Meanwhile, she was introduced to Jignesh Pandya, a resident of South Bopal, who claimed to be an insurance and investment expert. Seeking professional advice, Vaishali contacted Pandya, who introduced her to his wife, Ranna. Jignesh assured Vaishali that he held a high-ranking position at Bharti AXA Life Insurance and promised to manage her investment portfolio efficiently. He further claimed that he could double her money within just 21 days—an enticing proposition that ultimately led to her losing all her money. Trusting Jignesh, Vaishali initially handed over ₹10 lakh, which he doubled to ₹20 lakh and returned to her, further solidifying his credibility. Encouraged by this success, she made a much larger investment of ₹4.28 crore, expecting substantial returns. However, Jignesh and his wife only returned ₹40 lakh and withheld the rest, defrauding Vaishali of ₹3.87 crore in total. The Ghatlodia police have initiated an investigation into the matter.

Brawl during Ganesh sthapana at Shanti Business School leaves 12 injured,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/brawl-during-ganesh-sthapana-at-shanti-business-school-leaves-12-injured,2024-09-09,9,09,2024,"A confrontation between junior and senior students at Shanti Business School in Ahmedabad left 12 people injured on the campus on September 7. The fight had all the elements of a Bollywood potboiler – an SUV smashing the closed gates of the college to enter, while two groups clashed with sticks and fisticuffs. Bopal police have arrested three accused based on the cross complaints from both sides and have begun investigation. During the Ganesh sthapana at the business school, a first-year student Prachi Patel was allegedly told to move from a passage on the second floor in a rude manner by a senior named Yash Paneri, as per Patel’s complaint. Claiming to be a senior, Paneri asserted that he would talk to Patel in that tone. He also mocked Patel and her friends, stating that they would not be allowed in the college. The complaint states that Patel informed her father Gautam and brother Dhruvil, who arrived at the college in a Thar SUV. However, a group of 10 individuals including Paneri and his friend Vishwajit, with sticks in their hands created a ruckus at the institute, leading to Gautam falling unconscious when their car hit a wall. Following that, Patel filed a complaint against 10 people at the Bopal police station. In contrast, Paneri claimed that he asked Patel to move aside as a passage was built to place Ganesha’s idol. He claimed that the ruckus at the campus was created by Patel’s family members. The Thar, driven by Patel’s brother Dhruvil, rammed into the college gate and damaged a wall and a pole at the campus. Commenting on the incident, Director Dr Neha Sharma said, “The incident took place during Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations on the campus. A brawl between two groups of students escalated, and the family of a student intervened and threatened the lives of the students and staff in the campus. Police action has been taken in this regard.” The Bhopal police have arrested Gautam, Yash, and Vishwajit based on the complaints of both parties and have started further investigation.

The Crime Branch of the Ahmedabad police, which made the arrest, last month lodged a complaint against Chhabda for allegedly impersonating a central agency officer. The initial investigation revealed that the Gurugram native also targeted senior IAS and IPS officers, in addition to businesspersons. He is believed to have conned his way into crores of rupees. A special team from the crime branch used technical surveillance to track the accused to a salon in Karnal’s Ramesh Nagar. Modus operandi Chhabda’s modus operandi was simple yet effective. He tricked businesspersons into giving him large amounts of money, promising to launder their black money. He then blackmailed them for more, and threatened to have them raided by the income-tax department using his “PMO connections” if they did not fall in line. Over the past two to three years, Chhabda introduced himself to several businesspersons and hoteliers as either an officer from Gujarat’s Protocol Department or a Central government officer. On being interrogated in Ahmedabad, he revealed that he had carried out similar scams in Surat, Rajkot, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Bhopal, Srinagar, and Hyderabad. Web of deceit Chhabda’s phone and data records show that he had had contact with several senior IAS and IPS officers in different cities. Investigators say he told these officers he was a Central government officer working on government projects. Once he had gained their trust, he had them book—and foot the bill for—five-star hotel rooms and taxis. Chhabda also posed as a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker. He then met Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s relatives, Prahlad Modi and Pankaj Modi, and convinced them he was working on the “Akhand Bharat” project. He posed for pictures with them—pictures he would later use to further bolster his fake PMO credentials. Back home in Haryana, Chhabda continued to build up his image as a well-travelled businessman. What’s next? Sharad Singhal, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) in Ahmedabad, said that police departments in other states would be informed of Chhabda’s interactions with IAS and IPS officers there. He also commended the Deputy Commissioner of Police Ajit Raijan and Assistant Commissioner of Police Bharat Patel, who supervised the team that tracked Chhabda down. As the investigation continues, more explosive revelations are expected to follow. Also read: Another name added to fake officials from Ahmedabad in Gujarat",ahmedabad

The marijuana was loaded onto a truck in Odisha, with Gujarat as the final destination. The Crime Branch, which had earlier seized 194 kg of marijuana worth ₹42 lakh from a warehouse in the Vatva GIDC area on September 6, has now arrested the owner of the warehouse. Further investigation has disclosed that this was the second time the contraband had been stored in the warehouse, raising concerns about a well-established drug trafficking network. Ajit Rajiaan, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch), said, “We believe this is not the first time consignments have been delivered to Ahmedabad. Our primary investigation reveals that packages were also delivered to Bharuch, Kheda, Vadodara, and Anand, among other locations.” The police suspect that over the past two years, consignments of marijuana have been regularly shipped from Odisha to Gujarat. The operation was well-coordinated, with the truck drivers and helpers frequently changed after two or three deliveries to avoid detection. The delivery locations varied, with many packages being dropped off in farming lands across multiple cities. In the drug bust of September 6, the Crime Branch had arrested seven individuals in connection with the warehouse seizure. The accused were identified as Manikandan Mudaliar (47), Kumar Arun Pandey (30), Sanjay Shahu (36), Susanta Gouda (34), Ajay Tufan (27), Labha Gouda (42), and Sandeep Kumar Shah (23). The marijuana is believed to have originated from Ganjam village in Odisha and was intended for wide distribution across Gujarat. The Crime Branch is continuing its investigation to expose the full extent of the drug distribution network, which is suspected to span multiple cities. Ajit Rajiaan added, “This operation is part of a larger network that has been delivering consignments across various cities for some time. We are now working to trace the origins of this operation.” Also read: Ahmedabad Crime Branch seizes 194 kg drugs worth ₹42 lakh in Vatva GIDC Vatva GIDC drug bust: 500 kg marijuana delivered in Bharuch, peddler arrested",ahmedabad
Shastri Bridge closure exposes cracks in Ahmedabad’s infrastructure,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/shastri-bridge-closure-exposes-cracks-in-ahmedabads-infrastructure,2024-09-10,10,09,2024,"If you’re looking to go from Vasna to Pirana or Narol, buckle up! Literally! With half of Shastri Bridge still shut after it was “closed for four months” in December 2023, the half that is open to traffic is straining at the seams. Traffic crawls, occasionally grinding to a halt during peak hours (9–11 am and 7–9 pm) as six lanes of traffic squeeze into two. creating a massive bottleneck. Potholes, uneven asphalt, crumbling parapets, loose pavement blocks, and a wobbling bridge make every crossing a game of Russian roulette. Beyond the immediate structural dangers, lie longer journeys, higher fuel bills, and increased stress for both drivers and traffic authorities. As one commuter puts it, “The alternatives are way too long, and there is just as much traffic there, too. Every day, I get stuck on my commute both in the morning and the evening. Not only the bridge is operated on one side only, I also see heavy vehicles on it, which makes me anxious about bridge's structural integrity.” As with most things, there is a workaround if you’re willing to go the extra mile, or—in this case—the 6 km from Pirana to Ambedkar Bridge. Taking the Ambedkar Bridge instead of the Shastri Bridge, is an improvement in terms of traffic, but it adds 3.5 km to the Pirana–Vishala Circle route. Without traffic, this is 15 minutes longer, and with traffic, 30 mins or more—leaving commuters between a rock and a hard place. For commercial drivers, especially those with heavy vehicles (technically banned), it’s even more complicated. “The bridge is in such a bad shape that it is unsafe for heavy vehicles,” a traffic brigade officer told Gujarat Samachar Digital. “But, for transport owners, every extra kilometre means extra expenditure on diesel. So they often insist that their drivers take this bridge, leading to arguments.” It isn’t just intra-city traffic, either. As part of NH 64, the road extending from Shastri Bridge also connects Narol and the Ahmedabad–Vadodara Express Highway. Gujarat Samachar Digital can confirm that at least one GSRTC (Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation) bus did take the Shastri Bridge as we were talking to the traffic official. “Despite our warnings, they sometimes pass when we are between shifts,” the official admitted sheepishly. It is unclear if the current closure—coming as it did in December—has anything to do with the ₹6 crore worth of repairs announced in June 2023, after a picture of the sorry state of the bridge made waves on social media. The bridge is also slated for an eight-lane makeover worth ₹1,295 crore, but with no end date announced, the public has been left to grapple with the consequences. “Traffic would move quicker if the road were better maintained,” quips the traffic officer. “Vehicles like loading tempos and three-wheelers have a hard time on uneven roads, and get stuck, causing traffic jams.” Ironically, a bridge named after a staunch socialist has become a stark reminder of the need for efficient urban planning and timely maintenance in rapidly growing cities.

Following complaints and details received by the district educational officer (DEO), a circular was issued to all schools, ordering them to display the mandatory fee order on the school notice board. If schools fail to display the order, their recognition may be revoked. The Act mandates that private schools display their fee orders on notice boards and their websites. These orders, approved by the fee committee based on school proposals and affidavits, outline the fees charged to students. Despite this requirement, some schools have failed to comply. The Ahmedabad DEO has issued a strict warning to all private schools in the city to adhere to the law. Schools that violate the act and fail to display fee details publicly will face penalties, including the revocation of their recognition. The DEO has instructed school principals to ensure that fee orders are prominently displayed on notice boards and websites. Moreover, schools must submit photographs of the displayed orders to the DEO’s office for verification. This measure aims to provide parents with transparent information about school fees.

On contacting the airport authority in Ahmedabad, they stated the absence of a screening team from the health department at the airport.

On September 9, an investigation was conducted at Dipesh Sorathiya’s residence in Anjar, but he was missing. The police have launched teams to track down Sorathiya, who is reported to have gone underground. Following a complaint by Jawansinh Dabhi, a senior clerk at the Anjar Geology and Mining department office, Anjar police lodged a formal complaint against Sorathiya, a representative of Ranjit Buildcon on September 9 for fraudulent transactions involving royalties worth ₹3 crore.

Chauhan was found guilty of brutally murdering Kanchan and her son Vipul with an axe. The murders took place on June 3, 2017. Chauhan, who had been involved in an illicit relationship with Sujata, Vipul’s wife, attacked Kanchan while she was alone at home. He struck her multiple times on the head, killing her. After the murder, Chauhan wrapped Kanchan’s body in a saree to conceal the crime. When Vipul returned home and questioned Chauhan about the blood, Chauhan killed him with the same axe. The bodies were discovered by the police, who were alerted by a neighbor about a foul smell coming from the house. The bodies were found in a state of decomposition. In this case, public prosecutor Ramesh Patani presented 38 witnesses and substantial evidence to argue for the maximum penalty. The court highlighted that Chauhan’s actions were driven by the affair and subsequent retaliation against Kanchanand Vipul, who had sent Sujata back to her family in Maharashtra after discovering the illicit relationship. The court deemed the case as “rarest of rare,” justifying the imposition of the death penalty. The judge emphasised that the heinous nature of the crime demanded the harshest possible punishment to ensure justice.

This arrest follows a series of similar scams dating back to 2021, highlighting a pattern of fraudulent activities by the accused. On August 23, Mohit Prabhakar, a resident in Anjar, reported to the police that he received a phone call from an unknown number, where the caller identified himself as MP Vinod Chavda and requested ₹15,000 for Ganpati celebrations. The caller provided a bank account number for the transfer, which Prabhakar complied with at first. Suspicious of the transaction later, Prabhakar verified the caller’s number and discovered it was a fraud. The Gandhidham B Division police acted swiftly, forming a special team that tracked down Joshi from Ahmedabad’s Bapunagar. During interrogation, Joshi admitted to previously impersonating the MP for similar fraudulent activities. Joshi’s fraudulent scheme dates back to 2021, when he initially used the MP’s name to scam individuals under the guise of raising funds for Covid-19 relief. On May 20, 2021, Joshi defrauded Avnish Neka Ram Tripathi, a resident of Meghpar Kumbhardi’s Pushp Cottage Society, by pretending to be the MP and soliciting donations for Covid-19 patients. He collected a substantial sum of ₹6,96,000 in various bank accounts . In another instance on June 5, 2021, Joshi contacted Dipak Kewal Krishna Arora, general manager at Varrsana Ispat Limited, demanding ₹1 lakh as a donation for Covid-19 relief. When Arora grew suspicious and reported the scam to the Anjar police, Joshi’s fraudulent activities came under further scrutiny. Joshi also attempted to defraud the director of Maan Industries India Pvt Ltd on June 21, 2021, by soliciting ₹2.5 lakh for temple donations in Gandhidham, again using the MP’s name as a cover. Joshi, who had been previously apprehended for similar scams in Kutch, is now facing additional charges. The Gandhidham B Division police, led by PI S V Gojia, have secured a one-day remand for Joshi to facilitate further investigation.

District Judge K L Sojitra dismissed the application with a stern stance. Rejecting Patel’s bail, the court remarked, “The accused is involved in a serious crime, and if released on bail, there is a likelihood that he could tamper with evidence and witnesses.” Notably, Patel has been imprisoned for the last four years due to multiple charges of illegal land acquisition, and this is yet another instance where the court has denied him bail. The details of this sensational case date back to December 2023, when Patel was arrested for fraudulently acquiring land in Chekhla village using fabricated documents. During the bail hearing, Chief Public Prosecutor Pravin Trivedi strongly opposed Patel’s plea, stating, “The accused, along with others, orchestrated a premeditated conspiracy to fraudulently acquire land worth crores in Chekhla. Despite knowing that the land was classified under restricted rights, which legally prohibits registration, they registered the sale documents under various company names. Furthermore, they produced a fake and forged order at Sanand Mamlatdar’s office to convert the new conditional land into old terms, securing the fraudulent registration. The police have gathered ample evidence against the accused, including details of the fraudulent transactions and the companies involved. Patel has 11 prior cases registered against him for illegally acquiring farmers' land, and his financial power has played a significant role in his criminal activities. If granted bail, the possibility of evidence tampering cannot be ruled out.” In addition to the prosecutor’s opposition, the complainant and key witnesses also submitted written objections to granting bail to Patel. After hearing arguments from all sides, the court delivered its verdict, denying Patel’s bail once again.",ahmedabad

The court had previously instructed the state government to develop an all-encompassing helpline to address various civic issues.

It insisted that such systems should be operational at all times and criticised the lack of maintenance.

"Ahmedabad police nab man who posed as army officer, defrauded several women",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/national/ahmedabad-police-nab-man-who-posed-as-army-officer-defrauded-several-women,2024-09-14,14,09,2024,"Man pretends to be army official A man who was detained on suspicion of being a bag lifter turned out to be a conman who had posed as an army officer and defrauded several women across the country. He was arrested from Ahmedabad’s Kalupur railway station. The accused, who initially identified himself as Harshit Chaudhary, has confessed to using a fake name to deceive numerous victims. During the investigation, Ahmedabad police discovered that the accused had been operating under the alias ‘Harshit Chaudhary’ on the matrimonial site Shadi.com. Through this platform, he manipulated women, establishing intimate relationships with them while extorting money. When the police apprehended him on suspicion of theft at the railway station, they found an Army ID card, PAN card, and Aadhaar card, all under the name of Harshit Chaudhary. However, they also found an Aadhaar card with the name Mohammad Khan. Upon further interrogation, the man revealed his true identity – Mohammad Shehbaz Khan, a resident of Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh. Based on these fake documents, the police obtained his remand and took Shehbaz back to Aligarh for further investigation. In Aligarh, the authorities uncovered the full extent of Shehbaz’s fraud. Posing as Harshit Chaudhary, he used the matrimonial site to lure women into marriage proposals. One woman in Aligarh had already filed a formal complaint against Shehbaz, revealing that he had deceived women in various cities across the country, including Jammu & Kashmir, Siliguri, Gujarat, Mumbai, Delhi, and Aligarh. Shockingly, Shehbaz had manipulated 14 women, establishing physical relationships and extorting over ₹50 lakh from them. The investigation also revealed that Shehbaz had previously worked in the Indian Army, but was discharged on medical grounds. Despite this, he continued to present himself as a serving major to deceive his victims. He married a woman in Aligarh in 2016, and has two children. Shehbaz’s family background adds another layer to the case – his brother is an officer in the Indian Air Force, and his father is a retired army officer. Additionally, the police discovered a bank account in Punjab National Bank under the fake name Harshit Chaudhary. This account was opened using fraudulent documents, and the bank officials have since complained against him.",ahmedabad

Sunita Williams to cast vote in US presidential elections from space,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/international/sunita-williams-to-cast-vote-in-us-presidential-elections-from-space,2024-09-14,14,09,2024,"Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and her fellow NASA colleague Butch Wilmore, currently stuck on the International Space Station (ISS), expressed their anticipation today for casting their votes in the 2024 US presidential elections from space. Both astronauts emphasised the significance of fulfilling their civic duty despite being in orbit. Williams mentioned that they had already sent down their requests for ballots, adding, “Looking forward to voting from space, which is pretty cool.” Wilmore also stressed their responsibility as “American citizens,” noting that “NASA makes it very easy for us to do that.” The 2024 US elections, scheduled for Nov 5, will see a contest between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Williams and Wilmore are eager to participate in the electoral process despite their extended stay on the ISS. The two astronauts launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner on June 5, as part of the spacecraft’s first crewed mission. Originally slated for an eight-day mission, their stay has now stretched to eight months due to technical issues encountered by the Starliner, which recently returned to Earth without them. Commenting on being stuck in space, the Indian-origin astronaut said in a video press conference, “That’s how things go in this business.” She added that the transition to station life was “not that hard” since both astronauts had prior experience on the ISS. Reflecting on her extended mission, Williams shared, “This is my happy place. I love being up here in space.” While she and Wilmore had hoped to complete the Starliner mission and return home, Williams remarked, “We wanted to take Starliner to completion and land back on land at home, but you know, you have to turn the page and look at the next opportunity.” Both astronauts remain optimistic as they await their return, continuing their scientific endeavours while also preparing to vote in the 2024 presidential election from space.

The complaint alleges that the agency’s manager defrauded a couple by promising them a work permit for the UK. The complainants, Sanket Parihar and his wife, residents of Odhav, contacted Syntrofia Overseas Consultants, situated at Sachet-2 in Law Garden, in January 2024 for assistance with obtaining a work permit for the UK. They met with Devanshi Patel, who worked as a manager there. Devanshi quoted ₹35 lakhs for the work permit process, but the owner of the consultancy, Ankit Patel, finalised the cost at ₹30 lakhs. The aspirant couple were asked to pay ₹3 lakhs in advance for the process, which included medical check-ups and the IELTS exam. They were also charged ₹15 lakhs for the sponsorship letter. However, by June, no progress had been made, and Parihar received evasive responses. In July, they were asked for additional ₹5 lakhs for the visa process, with a warning that if the payment was not made, the visa would be cancelled. Parihar complied and paid the amount, with total payment now standing at ₹23 lakh. Ankit then processed their biometrics, but the next day Devanshi informed them that incorrect documents were found in their file and it would need to be withdrawn. During this period, Parihar discovered that Ankit and Devanshi had targeted several other individuals using similar fraudulent methods. Following this revelation, the Navrangpura police have registered a case and initiated further investigation.

In a tweet-war between Congress and the BJP over the bridge, the Gujarat Minister of Home Harsh Sanghavi stated that the total cost of ₹52 crore for the demolition and the reconstruction will be paid by the old builder. The bridge was originally built at the cost of ₹40 crore, however, the sub-par quality of the concrete used in the construction meant that the bridge could not be used. After several appeals by the townspeople, it was decided to demolish the bridge altogether and rebuild it. The demolition of the bridge is likely to cost ₹8 crore, and the reconstruction is estimated to cost ₹44 crore, adding ₹12 crore to the initial cost. Over this, the opposition Congress has alleged that the BJP is flaunting the reconstruction of a bridge that has now become a model of corruption. Citizens of Ahmedabad, who pay lakhs in taxes, are not getting any services even after suffering for a long time. On the other hand, Gujarat's minister of home has stated that the cost will be borne by the builder of the faulty bridge.

The mastermind, identified as Prahlad Nagar–resident Kapil Trivedi, is absconding. According to a police complaint filed by ad filmmaker Sumit Khanwani, BJP municipal worker Hitendrasinh Mori, Dhanrajsinh Rathod, Virendrasinh Chavda tried to plant “a white powder” and a beer bottle on him, and make off with his wallet. Khanwani claims that he was invited to meet one Saumil regarding the making of an advertisement in a room at the YMCA International Centre (YMCA). He says he later discovered that Trivedi had used the name “Gramir Joshi” to set up the meeting and book the room. What happened During Khanwal’s meeting, three men barged in claiming to be officials from the Central Bureau of Investigation. They allegedly injured Khanwani, planted “a beer bottle and a packet of white powder” in his bag, and demanded his wallet. Still, Khanwani managed to record a video of three assailants before they fled. Armed with his video evidence, Khanwal attempted to file a case with the Anandnagar police. However, he says, Inspector BK Bharai initially only accepted a simple application, and would not register a complaint until four days later. Eventually, the police investigation led to the arrest of Mori and his accomplices — all allegedly Trivedi’s friends — nine days after the incident. Khanwal claims that the police did nothing until he identified all the suspects and informed the police via social media; neither did they investigate the scene of the alleged crime. He also adds that the delay in filing the complaint allowed Trivedi, who lives barely 500m away from the Anand Nagar police station, enough time to evade the police.

"Ahmedabad recycles 1.67 million metric tons of construction waste, sets standard for sustainable urban practices",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ahmedabad-recycles-167-m-m-tons-of-construction-waste-sets-standard-for-sustainable-urban-practices,2024-09-17,17,09,2024,"Ahmedabad is setting a benchmark for sustainable waste management in India, having recycled an impressive 1.67 million metric tons of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste since 2015. This significant achievement highlights the city’s efforts  towards environmental sustainability and effective waste management practices. A new research released by Anant University, ‘Resource Efficiency and Recycling of Construction and Demolition Waste’, has highlighted Ahmedabad's leadership in sustainable waste management. The Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC), in collaboration with a private company, has been instrumental in processing 1,000 tons per day (TPD) of construction and demolition (C&D) waste. To further bolster its efforts, the AMC is constructing a second C&D waste processing facility in Gyaspur. This will enhance recycling capacity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with long-distance transportation of waste. Dr Sharadbala Joshi, senior researcher, emphasised the benefits of sustainable practices, noting their positive impact on both the environment and the economy. She highlighted the pivotal role of the Pirana recycle plant in Ahmedabad, which is leading in C&D waste recycling. Dr Joshi also advocated for policy changes, suggesting a reduction in GST on recycled materials and an increase on new materials to promote the use of recycled resources. The report underscores the importance of strategically locating recycling plants close to major construction sites to minimise transportation-related carbon footprints. Dr Joshi pointed out that current plants, though efficient, face high transportation costs and environmental impacts due to their distances from construction sites. Delhi, generating approximately 4,600 tonnes of C&D waste daily, was the first city in India to establish a dedicated processing facility for such waste. Despite early challenges, including a lack of demand for recycled products, the situation improved with new regulations mandating the use of recycled materials in government projects. Notably, over 1.6 million recycled concrete blocks from Delhi’s plant have been used in the new Supreme Court Annex building. Previously, Ahmedabad disposed of waste without treatment until 2012. Thereafter, the AMC issued an Expression of Interest for a C&D waste management plant. The AMC’s current budget for solid waste management exceeds ₹4,000 million, with a workforce of 13,000 and over 1,600 vehicles dedicated to waste collection and transportation. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has announced the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2024, effective April 1, 2025. These rules aim to regulate waste management from construction, demolition, and renovation activities, emphasising registration, coordination with local authorities, compliance with environmental standards, and proper disposal of rejects. The ongoing efforts to enhance recycling infrastructure and implement supportive policies underscore the city's role in sustainable urban development and climate action.

"Duality of GSRTC: Free rides in govt events, high fares for devotees",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/duality-of-gsrtc-free-rides-in-govt-events-high-fares-for-devotees,2024-09-18,18,09,2024,"The recent Bhadravi Purnima festival at the Ambaji temple has highlighted a strike disparity between the government’s treatment of its leaders during state-sponsored programmes and the general public. While the government actively promotes Hindu values and benefits financially from the influx of devotees during religious festivals such as Bhadarvi Purnima in Ambaji, it has been criticised for charging high fares for temple visits while providing free transportation for its own events at the same time. In Ambaji, the GSRTC (Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation) buses increased bus fares from ₹13 to ₹20 during the fair, drawing widespread criticism from devotees. Despite a reduction of ₹5 in fares following public outcry, the net increase in fares of ₹15 still burdened pilgrims. According to sources, the corporation has reportedly earned ₹50 lakh from the fare hike, underscoring the government’s financial interest in religious tourism. The government has faced criticism for leveraging these ST buses to amass large crowds for its programmes while failing to fully settle the associated costs. The BJP government has rented 34,614 buses for its various programmes in last year. For this, ₹56.01 crore have been paid to GSRTC, however, a payment of ₹53.81 crore still remains to be paid. This dual approach, where the government prioritises its events and people while neglecting the needs of the general public, has raised concerns about its priorities. Similarly in Ahmedabad, the AMTS (Amdavad Municipal Transportation Service)  bus service has taken a loan of ₹350 crores from Amdavad Municipal Corporation. Now to repay the loan AMC has diverted the AMTS buses for government programmes to help repayment of loans which is causing inconvenience to daily commuters. During a recent BJP event at GMDC, hundreds of buses were deployed, leading to disruptions in routine bus services.

Harsh Sanghavi, Gujarat’s Home Minister, whose name had been mentioned as a possible candidate for the acting CM, has denied these rumors. Sanghavi labeled them baseless and even threatened legal action against those spreading misinformation.

Some have even suggested that acting CM might be appointed during Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s Gujarat Visit.

Due to the alertness and honesty of the cleaning staff, 750 grams of gold was found in the bathroom and seized. Dinesh Garwa, a cleaner at Ahmedabad’s SVPI airport, was busy with his regular cleaning duty. While cleaning the men’s restroom, his attention was drawn to a suspicious packet found in the dustbin. Though the packet appeared empty, it felt unusually heavy, strengthening his suspicion that something was wrong. He decided to open the packet to resolve his doubts. Upon opening it, he found several carefully packed, sealed packets inside. Garwa promptly informed his supervisor and the customs officials. Upon inspecting the packet, customs officials found 750 grams of pure gold paste. The estimated value of the gold is around ₹5.5 million (55 lakhs). Talking about the incident, Garwa said, “I was just doing my duty. When the dustbin felt unusually heavy, I grew suspicious.” An investigation has begun to determine who hid the 750 grams of gold in the restroom dustbin, to whom it was supposed to be delivered, and who else might be involved. Following this incident, surveillance has been increased in every possible place smugglers might hide gold. Modus operandi Smugglers often use the help of carriers. These carriers mainly bring gold from Dubai or Bangkok. In exchange for their services, the carriers are provided with flight tickets, accommodation, meals, and commissions. They hide gold behind their knees, seal it inside luggage, or conceal it in undergarments, sanitary napkins, and private parts. If customs surveillance is high, they sometimes hide the gold in airport restrooms, where an accomplice can later retrieve it.

Dr Bhavin Solanki, the Amdavad Municipal Corporation’s medical officer, said that efforts are being made to prevent mosquito breeding in various places like malls, complexes, and construction sites. However, he admits that the civic body has received several complaints that third-party contractors are not providing adequate fogging. Notices have been issued to agencies like HPC and CWC regarding this serious matter, he said. Further, none of the 213 samples collected by the AMC in September showed the presence of chlorine. With the outpatient departments of AMC hospitals and urban health centres full of dengue and chikungunya patients, the Opposition has alleged that civic officials are downplaying the situation. It says that the official figures do not include the number of patients being treated at home or in private hospitals.

After the state government submitted an affidavit outlining the steps taken to address these issues, including the number of cases registered and fines collected, Justice Sandeep N Bhatt expressed dissatisfaction with their response. The petitioner had drawn the court’s attention to the illegal parking of luxury buses on public roads and footpaths. Justice Bhatt granted the authorities another month to take effective action. Earlier, the HC had directed the Home Secretary, Transport Commissioner, DGP, RTO, and other responsible officers to submit a detailed affidavit explaining the steps taken to improve the traffic system. In response, the government stated that a State Complaint Redressal Cell with a toll-free number (18002331122) and an email address (trafficgrievance@gujarat.gov.in) had been set up to address public grievances related to traffic and illegal parking. The authorities have also been directed to implement an e-detection project to collect data from toll plazas on national and state highways, ensuring that vehicles passing through have valid fitness certificates and pollution control certificates. Any violations will result in automatic e-challans. Additionally, a centralised monitoring project is in the pipeline to identify vehicles violating traffic rules through a mobile app. The court has also directed all RTOs and ARTOs (Additional Regional Transport Offices) to strictly enforce motor vehicle laws and conduct regular drives. The petitioner in turn argued that the government’s claims were not reflective of the ground reality, pointing out that illegal parking of luxury buses persisted despite the court’s orders. The petitioner also raised concerns about the practice of traffic police collecting fines in cash and the lack of proper identification for personnel collecting fines.

Schools must ensure that no student drives a vehicle without authorisation,” the guidelines state. The DEO, in collaboration with the RTO, will conduct surprise checks in schools. If any student is found driving a bike or scooter without a learning licence, action will be taken as per the rules. Even students driving electric scooters will be checked, as there are specific rules mandated for them. The checking will begin a week later, and from September 20, a road safety training program will be organised for school principals.

Police allegedly freeze ₹2 cr of Ahmedabad businessman over fake complaint,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/police-allegedly-freeze-2-cr-of-ahmedabad-businessman-over-fake-complaint,2024-09-19,19,09,2024,"Police officials in Ahmedabad, instead of protecting the people, have been alleged of collusion with outsiders to freeze a bank account containing ₹2 crore based on a fabricated e-cheating complaint. This incident has raised serious questions about the integrity of the police force and the misuse of their powers. According to sources, three to four police personnel from three police stations in Ahmedabad, along with their accomplices, have been under internal investigation. A businessman’s account, containing ₹2 crore, was frozen based on a complaint of e-cheating worth ₹2,999. The complainant alleged that he had clicked on a link for investment and paid ₹2,999 into the businessman’s account. Acting on this complaint, the police froze the businessman’s bank account without conducting any preliminary investigation. The businessman was then informed that unfreezing the account would cost 10% of the frozen amount, i.e., ₹20 lakh. Upon realising that something was amiss, the businessman contacted senior police officials. It was discovered that a fake e-cheating complaint had been filed, falsely implicating the businessman. A police officer, in collusion with an accomplice, had deposited ₹2,999 and filed a complaint alleging e-cheating, providing the businessman’s bank account details. The frozen amount was eventually unfrozen after a preliminary investigation. Also read : Navrangpura-based visa consultancy defrauds couple of ₹23 lakh",ahmedabad

NID Ahmedabad hosts Terra Carta Design Lab showcasing sustainable solutions to climate change,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/nid-ahmedabad-hosts-terra-carta-design-lab-showcasing-sustainable-solutions-to-climate-change,2024-09-20,20,09,2024,"NID Ahmedabad In a bid to address the ongoing climate crisis globally, the National Institute of Design (NID) Ahmedabad has come up with the Terra Carta Design Lab on its campus. As one of the participants of the Design Lab 2023-24 competition, the premier design institute will compete with Rhode Island School of Design (USA), Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation (UAE), and Royal College of Art (UK), to produce climate sustainable projects through designing. An exhibition at the institute will showcase various projects designed by the students. It will be on display for the public from September 21. The steering group of this initiative from NID includes its director Praveen Nahar, Tanishka Kachru, chairperson of international programme, and Rishi Singhal, vice-chairperson of international programme, among others. Terra Carta Design Lab The Terra Carta was introduced in 2021 by King Charles III as part of the Sustainable Markets’ Initiative. It groups sustainability with the private sector, and pushes it into every aspect of our economy. It emphasises a productive and sustainable future, which integrates nature, people, and the planet. The competition focused around four crucial areas: circular economy, energy efficiency, good health and well being, and investing in nature. NID's exhibition NID’s approach to the competition focused on creating integrated, just, and culturally sensitive solutions to environmental and social challenges. Speaking on the institute’s bid for this competition, NID Director Praveen Nahar said, “Tera Carta Design Lab here is a wonderful initiative, and the idea behind it is to bring our young design talent to respond to our climate change issues and build sustainable enterprise around that.” Speaking further, Nahar said, “This opportunity came up and we were invited by Prince Charles foundation in the UK along with three other prestigious design schools around the world. We have put our young graduates as well as senior design students behind this and there was a lot of warm response to this.” Talking over the preparation behind the institute for this competition, NID’s International Programme chairperson Tanishka Kachru said, “Since this is a global competition, I’m also the academic lead for this, and also behind setting up the lab here. The entire process happened over a period of about 6 months where a lot of learning and creating was involved. One of the strategies that we used was to decentralise the lab, and make it not something where you physically have to be all the time because we want our young alumni to also be able to participate. So this lab became a space for mentorship as well as for accessing resources. It also became a platform where climate experts, scientists, designers, and technologists came together to provide their mentorship.” Talking about the students’ enthusiasm for such an initiative, Kachru remarked, “A lot of them have actually worked on prototypes which are physically testing their ideas, for which they’ve also done a lot of field testing. Most of the projects are actually based on the context from the real world. For example, one of them collaborated in a way with the European Space Agency for the implementation of an idea which dealt with survival in deep space, and to find a terrestrial application for it. Another project, being worked on by a student based in Kerala, involved researching, collecting data, and developing experiments based on resources available there. It involved the Kochi Municipal Corporation who helped that student. Another project was worked on in the Himalayas, where they were working with the local organisations, and also a few local nonprofit organisations.” The exhibition will be open for all at the NID Ahmedabad campus from September 21 to October 2, and will be open from 11 am to 7 pm for the visitors.",ahmedabad
Faced with an emergency in public in Ahmedabad? Turn to the emergency call box,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/emergency-in-public-ahmedabad-emergency-call-box-ahmedabad-police,2024-09-20,20,09,2024,"Emergency box Ahmedabad As Navratri is around the corner, late-night revellers will enjoy the festive spirit across the city. Amidst the excitement, ensuring women’s safety remains a top priority. It is imperative to know that the Gujarat Police has initiated an ‘emergency call box’ system under the ‘Nirbhaya Safe City’ project, designed to create a safer environment for citizens. For the safety of the public, specifically women, children, and senior citizens in any emergency, the police have installed a total of 205 emergency call boxes across all the seven zones of the city. How does an emergency call box work If someone meets with an accident, there is a threat to women’s safety or there is a brawl on the street, the victim or the third person can locate a metallic box usually installed on the CCTV poles and press the red button on the device. Once pressed, the police control room (PCR) will receive a video call or voice call depending on the type of device. The device caters to two-way communication directly to the PCR. A policeman will ask you for basic details including your location, name, and contact number. In a demo call by Gujarat Samachar Digital, the PCR responder assured the reporter that a PCR van will reach the spot in 10 minutes. Currently, over 205 emergency call boxes have been installed in Ahmedabad, yielding positive results, with around 100 calls being received daily. However, many Amdavadis including youth are unaware of these boxes. Where are the boxes? Being a hub for education and employment, the city attracts people from across the nation. The emergency call boxes are prominently installed near AMTS and BRTS bus stations, universities, hospitals, schools and secluded lanes. For now, a total of 181 places across Ahmedabad have these boxes including: - New Cloth Market - Bhadra - Delhi Darwaja - Raipur Darwaja - Police commissioner’s office - LG Hospital - Khokhra - CTM Cross Road - Soni ni chali - Navrangpura char rasta - IIM - Judges Bungalow Road - Gujarat University - Asarwa lake - Kubernagar - GTU College - GTU girls’ hostel - Gujarat College girls’ hostel - Vidhyanagar School (Usmanpura) - Azad Society cross road - SG Highway - Prahlad Nagar - Natraj Cinema - Chandkheda gam - Mount Carmel School - Paldi - Vasna - Subhash Bridge Out of five boxes tested at the prime locations by the team of Gujarat Samachar Digital, only two were in working condition.

Both cases were promptly transferred to the respective police stations for further action.” The ECBs are strategically placed throughout the city to ensure swift police response, providing an additional layer of security and rapid assistance for the public. Woman assaulted by son On September 18, around 12.30pm, a heavily intoxicated man was assaulting his mother Gitaben near the Gokul tea stall in Gujarat University area. Without a mobile phone to call for help, Gitaben used the nearby Emergency Call Box (ECB) to alert the police. According to authorities, the man not only assaulted Gitaben, but also threw stones at her. In her desperation, she immediately pressed the button on the ECB, which immediately connected her to the police control room. A PCR van was quickly dispatched, and officers arrived at the scene to investigate the matter. The Gujarat University Police Station immediately restrained the man. GU Police Inspector S R Bava said, “The swift use of the Emergency Call Box allowed us to intervene before the situation escalated further. We are investigating further.” Anonymous tip leads to raid on gambling den In another instance showcasing the effectiveness of Ahmedabad's ECB, an anonymous tip-off was received through an ECB located near Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium on September 18 around 4pm. The unidentified caller reported illegal gambling activity at a nearby location. Acting on the information, the Bapunagar police dispatched a PCR van to raid the suspected gambling den. However, by the time the police arrived, the gamblers had already fled. Bapunagar Police Inspector A D Gamit confirmed the raid, “We responded swiftly to the tip-off, but unfortunately, the individuals fled before we could arrest anyone. We are working to trace those involved.” These cases underline the importance of the ECB system in ensuring quick police intervention in critical situations across the city.",ahmedabad

The court’s decision came in response to a contempt petition filed by advocate Amit Panchal, who highlighted the government's inaction on these pressing issues. Justices A Y Kogje and Sameer Dave expressed their deep concern over the deteriorating traffic situation in the state and the government's lack of effective solutions. They emphasised the need for a comprehensive approach to tackle these problems, including the implementation of a zonal strategy in Ahmedabad. Despite the establishment of a grievance redressal cell by the government, the court was not satisfied with its performance. The cell received a total of 444 complaints, but the government was unable to provide a clear timeline for their resolution. The court also criticised the lack of accountability among government officials, noting their failure to address citizens' concerns effectively. The High Court issued a stern warning to the government, demanding immediate action to improve traffic management, curb illegal parking, and enhance the quality of life for citizens.

As previously reported by Gujarat Samachar Digital, Paldi-resident Virendra Patel has accused his father-in-law Kantilal Patel of pressuring him into taking a 70% stake in a ₹3 cr land deal, and then stealing the land using forged documents. Virendra also named his wife, Gopi, and two others in the case of falsifying documents. He says Gopi and Kantilal used the forged documents to transfer his stake to them, while he was working in Australia at his father-in-law’s behest. Now, officials close to the investigation say that Kantilal, a trustee at Sardar Dham, may have sold the land to BJP leaders with whom he is well connected. What we know so far 2018: A fraudulent retirement deed in Virendra’s name was created, indicating that he had exited the partnership in 2016–17. 2019: Kantibhai and other accused prepared a bogus power of attorney (POA) using fake signatures of Virendra. Using these forged documents, they transferred ownership of land worth crores to Kantilal and Gopi. 2023: Based on the unauthorised documents, the land was sold to top BJP leaders. Despite objections, the Mamlatdar (revenue officer) registered the land deal, allegedly under government pressure. Suspicions have now arisen of involvement from officials in the Collector’s office. Court Action: Virendra sought justice in court, presenting evidence including a signature expert’s report. The court invoked Section 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, ordering a case to be registered against Kantibhai and the other accused.

Despite the court’s clear instructions, AMC officials initiated the removal process overnight, prompting a stern rebuke from Justice Nikhil Kareliya. The court questioned the AMC’s disregard for the stay order, demanding to know why the officials had chosen to disobey the court’s directives. Justice Kareliya stated, “If the High Court has granted relief and issued a stay to the petitioners, why haven’t you adhered to the order?” To ensure compliance, the court imposed a strict deadline, warning that if any hoardings were removed after 5 pm on September 19, the municipal commissioner would be required to appear before the court. The AMC’s lawyer assured the court that no further actions would be taken, but the court remained vigilant. The High Court emphasised that if the AMC violated its assurance and proceeded with the removal of hoardings, the petitioners would have the right to bring the matter immediately to the court’s attention. The court reprimanded the AMC for its disregard of the stay order, stating that the corporation should have filed a civil application for clarification if it intended to take any action. The AMC’s lack of satisfactory explanations for its actions further fueled the court’s criticism. The incident stems from a previous legal battle between various advertising agencies and the AMC over the corporation’s new hoarding policy. The High Court had granted relief to the agencies and issued a stay order against the removal of their associated hoardings. However, the AMC’s removal of the hoardings prompted the agencies to file a new petition seeking justice. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for September 25.

With this, the corporation has spent nearly ₹50 crores in last four years, fixing 363 potholes. This year, 14 potholes formed due to damage to the drainage lines, costing the municipal authorities ₹73.12 lakhs for repairs. Additionally, 11 potholes resulted from issues with manholes, costing ₹47.5 lakhs to fix. Another 19 potholes arose from various other causes. In total, the repair of 44 potholes has cost the municipal authorities over ₹1.20 crores. Many potholes were caused by damage to manholes, drainage lines, or damage to the RCC. Damage has also occurred due to the construction activities related to the bullet train project beneath bridges, which has been repaired by the railway authorities. AMC lacks a clear policy to prevent potholes caused by breakdowns in drainage lines or manholes, leading to delays of 10 to 15 days in repairs after potholes form, increasing the difficulties for residents. Despite the ongoing issues, there appears to be little impact on the authorities. From road construction to pothole repairs, municipal officials, contractors, and politicians are collectively spending around ₹1,000 crores annually on new roads, resurfacing existing roads, and repairing potholes.

The gruesome incident took place on the night of September 6 in the crematorium of Bakrol village, located in the Ahmedabad district. According to police, Heena had eloped twice with a boy from her village and community, an act that angered her family. In a tragic turn of events, her father, uncles, and cousins conspired to kill her. On the pretext of visiting a temple in Vadodara, the accused took Heena to the Narmada Canal near Halol Highway and strangled her to death.

Khachar, who worked in the economic crime branch, is currently incarcerated in connection with the suicide of Dr Vaishali Joshi earlier this year. Jail officials indicate the visit was private, with no official announcement made. The suicide of 32-year-old Dr Joshi on March 14, 2024, at the Ahmedabad Crime Branch campus sent shockwaves through the city. She injected poison into her hand after PI Khachar allegedly refused to meet her after breaking off a five-year affair. A 15-page suicide note found in her purse explicitly stated that Khachar was responsible for her decision to end her life. The note also requested that he perform her last rites. After the incident, Khachar initially absconded but surrendered after his anticipatory bail application was rejected by the Gujarat High Court. He was interrogated for eight hours by Ahmedabad E Division SP Vani Dudhat, during which his mobile phone, laptop, and other documents were seized. Meanwhile, the singer, known for presenting Gujarati folk literature at concerts, is out on bail in a case relating to an assault on builder Mayursinh Rana in Rajkot. Khavad and his associates allegedly attacked Rana with a pipe on December 7, 2022, leading to a case registered at the A-Division Police Station. After evading authorities for 10 days, Khavad surrendered and was initially granted a two-day remand. On December 19, 2022, Khavad and three other accused were produced in court, where police didn't seek further remand, resulting in their imprisonment. In February 2023, the High Court gave Khavad bail, on the condition that he not enter Rajkot for six months.

A preliminary investigation revealed that this consignment had been sent from Bhiwandi to a company in Vatva. As there is a possibility that these chemicals could be methanol or ethanol alcohol, arrangements have been made to obtain an FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory) report. Based on this report, the police will take further action. SMC Deputy Superintendent of Police, K T Kamariya, stated that these chemicals are used in industries, but the person who ordered the consignment did not have a licence. Additionally, there is a possibility that the consignment contains methanol or ethanol alcohol. Hence, FSL’s assistance is being sought to confirm the type of chemical. If the chemical is confirmed to be ethanol or methanol alcohol, a formal complaint will be lodged, and legal action will be taken. The company in Bhiwandi that sent the consignment will also be investigated. Notably, ethanol and methanol chemicals have previously been used in incidents like the 2022 chemical tragedy in Dhandhuka and Botad and the infamous Gujarat hooch tragedy.

FIR against 7 for spreading misinformation that Amul Ghee was used in Tirupati prasadam,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/fir-against-7-for-spreading-misinformation-that-amul-ghee-was-used-in-tirupati-prasadam,2024-09-21,21,09,2024,"Ahmedabad Police have filed a case against seven X users for allegedly spreading false information about the use of 'Amul' ghee in laddus at the Tirupati temple. The Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which markets 'Amul', has denied supplying ghee to the temple. Earlier, Andhra Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu stated that animal products were used in the preparation of the famous laddu of Tirumala temple. TDP spokesman Anam Venkata Ramana Reddy had also revealed that a report of a sample of ghee tested at a Gujarat-based livestock laboratory confirmed the presence of foreign fat. The test done at the Centre of Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) at the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), a facility recognized by the Central government, shows the ghee contained suspected adulterants. These also included soybean, sunflower, olive, rapeseed, linseed, what germ, maize germ, cotton seed, coconut, palm kernel fat, and palm oil. The CALF received the sample on July 9, while the lab report was dated July 16. The TDP spokesperson cited the report after the YSR Congress Party slammed the Chief Minister for making the claim the laddu had animal product. YSRCP MP Y V Subba Reddy, who was the Chairman of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) when the YSRCP was in power, termed the allegation ""malicious"" and said that Naidu would ""stoop to any level for political gain"". Subba Reddy, who is the uncle of former Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy, said Naidu had severely damaged the sanctity of the Tirumala temple and the faith of crores of Hindus with his remarks. To counter Subba Reddy’s allegation, Anam Venkata Ramana Reddy displayed the lab report at a news conference. The TDP spokesperson also pointed out that premium-quality ghee typically costs over ₹1,000 per kg but the TTD, under the previous government, awarded the contract for the supply of ghee at a mere ₹320 per kg, implying that such a low price could only be met through substandard sourcing or corruption. The TDP leader claimed that the tender for 15,000 kg of ghee was potentially linked to bribery, raising concerns over transparency and accountability in government contracts. He also lashed out at the YSRCP for not even establishing a dedicated lab for ghee certification, which could not have cost more than ₹75 lakh. Earlier, Social Welfare Minister Dola Sree Bala Veeranjaneya Swamy said that a comprehensive inquiry will be conducted into irregularities in TTD. The minister told media persons that the Chief Minister repeated what the officials have already stated on the quality of ingredients used in making laddu, also known as Tirumala laddu. The famous sweet is given as prasadam to the devotees at the famous Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati, which is run by TTD, a body nominated by the state government.

While it is par for the course for ageing buildings to be demolished and rebuilt, these EWS homes were barely a decade old. Constructed in 2014 as part of a larger project of 8,960 units built in six phases, several of the demolished houses were never allocated to beneficiaries despite a 2017 CAG report highlighting the issue. The demolition drive, which began on July 15, 2023, has raised serious questions about the city’s housing allocation policies, structural integrity of its buildings, and the apparent disconnect between elected officials and administrative actions. Dissent in the ranks? Adding to the controversy is that Ahmedabad Mayor Pratibha Jain has washed her hands of the situation, claiming ignorance of the large-scale demolition. “If you’ve taken action, you should answer the media,” she reportedly told civic officials after a protest on September 20, where the Opposition demanded a swift and thorough investigation into the razing. This is a unique instance in which members of the majority party have taken an aggressive stance against the administrative body. Cracks in the system As per the city’s contract signed with MV Omni, which built the demolished units, the defect liability period ended in 2017. According to Deputy Municipal Commissioner Rigdhesh Rawal, a structural stability study commissioned in March 2023 reported issues such as protruding roof rails, wall gaps, and a collapsed house. This led to the decision to demolish 52 of the 59 blocks, or 2,200 homes, built in the fifth phase of the EWS housing project, which had cost the city ₹55.2 crore, he said. Currently, 224 dwellings remain occupied. Contractor LJ Purani has been tasked with clearing debris from the demolition site. Speculations abound Area residents suspect that unallocated EWS housing in Vatva is being razed under political pressure to free up land for the high-speed rail corridor being constructed between Ahmedabad and Mumbai. The AMC has an annual budget of ₹12,000 crore. It also receives annual grants worth crores under various Central and state government housing schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana to build housing units. Given this apparent abundance of resources, it is concerning that the AMC permitted the construction of EWS housing of such low quality that it deteriorated within less than a decade. Also concerning is that the civic body failed to allocate houses, even after the CAG report. Yet, perhaps the most perplexing issue is how the AMC managed to sneak a mass-demolition order past its leader, without her getting a whiff of it. As Ahmedabad grapples with this housing demolition controversy, the incident raises serious questions about governance, accountability, and the fate of affordable housing initiatives in the city.

The accused posed as CBI and Mumbai Crime Branch officials to threaten the victim and extort money from her. The arrested suspects – Ravi Sawani, Sumit Moradiya, Prakash Gajera, Piyush Malaviya, and Kalpesh Rojasara – were linked to a prior case in which five others were already apprehended for similar offences.

Zoning change in 500 acres of Godhavi pave way for Olympic facilities,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/zoning-change-in-500-acres-of-godhavi-pave-way-for-olympic-facilities,2024-09-22,22,09,2024,"In the Godhavi area of Ahmedabad, specific locations adjacent to the Amdavad Municipal Corporation limits are undergoing a zoning change. This decision is driven by the city’s growing areas and future demand, aiming to provide amenities for urban residents settling in the region. According to informed sources, these changes have been made to enhance social and educational facilities as well as improve infrastructure. Importantly, previous announcements have highlighted the ambition to establish Olympic-level sporting facilities in Ahmedabad, alongside institutes of excellence. This vision aligns with the development of the new zoning, which will focus on creating top-notch facilities for sports and recreation. The Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act of 1976 permits immediate implementation of this decision. In the newly designated zone of 500 acres in Godhavi, housing, commercial, and retail activities will not be permitted. This area was previously designated as an agricultural zone in 2014. On September 12, the Gujarat government’s Urban Development and Urban Housing Department issued a notification explaining the intent to change the zoning. According to this announcement, the 500-acre area in Godhavi will now fall under a restricted institutional, sports, and recreational zone (KZ-3). Only educational and sports-related activities will be allowed in this zone, paving the way for the planned Olympic-level sporting events and facilities. The primary notification was released on September 12, in accordance with Section 19(1) of the Gujarat Town Planning Act of 1976. Developers in the area will receive incentives of up to 12% on the Floor Space Index (FSI) charges. Star zones will be recognised as Silver Zones, offering a 7% incentive on FSI charges for development. Four-Star Zones will be classified as Gold Zones with a 10% incentive, while Platinum Zones will provide a 12% incentive on chargeable FSI. Obtaining pre-certification is mandatory to qualify for these incentives. The following survey numbers in Godhavi have been included in the zoning change: 80-P, 84-P, 85-P, 90-P, 94-P, 41-P, 42-P, and 43-P. Most survey numbers from 41-P to 710-P fall within the 500-acre area. This land will be utilised for developing a knowledge zone and institutional zone, enhancing the potential for Olympic-level sports facilities in the region.

Over 1k Pradhan Mantri Awas houses in Ahmedabad stuck after contractor leaves midway,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/over-1k-pradhan-mantri-awas-houses-in-ahmedabad-stuck-after-contractor-leaves-midway,2024-09-22,22,09,2024,"In a concerning development, the construction of 1,180 houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in the Thaltej area of Ahmedabad has come to a standstill, leaving beneficiaries without any prospects for their new residences. A budget of ₹59 crore was allocated for this project, with the expectation that it would address housing needs in the region. The contractor, Sanghani Infrastructure Private Limited, was awarded the work order in 2019, and construction began on March 8, 2019. However, despite completing approximately 80% of the work, the contractor informed the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC) that they would not continue with the project. This abrupt halt has left many would-be residents frustrated, as they now find themselves navigating the complexities of municipal offices in search of solutions. In response to the situation, the AMC has decided to blacklist the contractor, ensuring the contractor will not be able to take on future projects. The city engineer has stated that all remaining construction will be completed at the contractor’s expense, with plans to re-tender the project to ensure its completion. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana was designed to provide affordable housing for all, and government advertisements have touted the benefits of such schemes. However, the reality on the ground has often failed to meet these promises. Housing projects, like the one in Thaltej, have faced delays and issues related to construction quality, leaving beneficiaries disappointed. Adding to the concern, houses constructed under similar schemes in the Behrampura area of the city have reportedly deteriorated significantly in just ten years, raising questions about the quality of work and the effectiveness of oversight by the AMC. The residents who were meant to benefit from this housing scheme are left waiting, hoping for a swift resolution and the promise of a home that remains just out of reach.

"4 Swaminarayan Vadtal monks accused of ₹1.76 cr fraud over building of temple, cow shelter",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/4-swaminarayan-vadtal-monks-accused-of-1-76-cr-fraud-over-building-of-temple-cow-shelter,2024-09-22,22,09,2024,"A new case has been filed against the Swaminarayan sect in Vadtal, alleging a ₹1.76 crore fraud involving farmers and landowners in the name of building a temple. The accused reportedly solicited substantial investments to purchase land for both a temple and a cow shelter. The CID Crime has charged four monks from the Swaminarayan sect, a farmer, and four others in connection with this scheme. According to the complaint, two individuals involved in land transactions in Ahmedabad conspired with the monks to defraud the complainant of ₹1.76 crore for the proposed temple and cow shelter in Limb village, Bayad. The complainant, Dhanshyam Vaghela, along with his partner Dilip Patel, operates a land brokerage in Vadtal. In December 2023, they were approached by Suresh Thori and Lalji Dhola, who claimed to manage land deals in Surat. They informed Vaghela that the Swaminarayan sect needed between 500 to 700 acres of land for the temple and cow shelter but could not negotiate directly with farmers. Subsequently, Vaghela met with monks Dev Prakash Swami, Madhavpriya Swami, Vijay Prakash Swami, and Jay Krishna Swami in Anand. They claimed to be disciples of Notam Swami and discussed plans for constructing a large temple in Limb village. Vaghela was promised ₹5 crore in return for purchasing the land, which they said would come from donations in Dubai. Trusting the monks, Vaghela purchased land from Vijay Chauhan and Bhupendra Patel, paying ₹1.11 crore to the landowners. Thori and Dhola assured him that once he presented the land agreement to the monks, they would facilitate the transfer of ₹5 crore. During this time, D P Swami and V P Swami conducted meetings with Vaghela, during which they paid him ₹21 lakh and secured the original land agreement. As Chauhan informed that as the pressure mounted from the farmers for payment, Vaghela sent Chauhan and Patel ₹40 lakh. Vaghela even booked flight tickets for the monks and two brokers travelling from Surat to Dubai to collect more funds. However, after their return, Vaghela became suspicious when, on February 13, D P Swami, Lalji, and Suresh introduced him to two individuals who were purportedly donating ₹5 crore for the temple. The fact that these donors were Muslim raised concerns for Vaghela. Later, the monks explained that 250 acres would be allocated for the temple and another 250 acres for the cow shelter. As doubts grew, Vaghela’s investigation revealed that Chauhan and Patel had not purchased any land from farmers and were colluding with the monks. After uncovering the fraudulent scheme, Vaghela reported the matter to CID Crime, leading to the registration of a case against the accused, including four monks from the Vadtal Swaminarayan sect.

This directive follows concerns raised during a public interest litigation filed by Advocate Amit Panchal, particularly regarding the unauthorised disposal of plastic waste by the Junagadh Municipal Corporation through private operators without necessary approvals. During the hearing, Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Pranav Trivedi expressed their dissatisfaction with the Junagadh Municipal Corporation’s actions, holding the Municipal Commissioner accountable for violating the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. The court instructed the GPCB to conduct inspections of all sites where plastic waste management has been contracted to private agencies and to take appropriate action against any sites found in violation of the 2016 rules. This includes issuing show-cause notices and imposing fines, with opportunities for affected parties to respond. The court also sought a detailed report from the Junagadh Municipal Commissioner on how plastic waste is managed in the Girnar Mountain and eco-sensitive zone areas. It was revealed that three private operators were assigned tasks related to plastic waste management without the required GPCB approvals, raising serious compliance concerns. Additionally, the High Court has requested a response from the state government regarding the establishment of a state-level monitoring committee to ensure effective implementation of the Plastic Waste Management Rules. The Additional Chief Secretary has been ordered to submit an affidavit on the matter, with further hearings scheduled for next month.

Previously, the Gujarat High Court had also rejected a request to allow private buses to operate from 8 am to 10 pm in the city. Following that, the private bus operators challenged this ruling in the Supreme Court. Demand for Business Rights Private travel agencies appealed to the Supreme Court, citing their rights to conduct business and referencing RTO regulations. In 2004, an approval was granted for 24-hour operations of private buses on 18 routes, and the operators requested of this authorisation to be maintained. High Court Questions Bus Operators In its ruling, the Gujarat High Court had noted, “Has the situation changed in the last 18 years? Over the past two decades, the number of vehicles has increased, traffic management has become more challenging, and accidents have risen. How can police-imposed restrictions be deemed inappropriate without solid data? Operators are responsible for making arrangements for those wishing to use private bus services.” The Gujarat high court on Oct 19 had upheld the direction of the city police commissioner to prohibit private buses within the city limits during the day. The private bus operators of the city had challenged the police notification restricting the entry of private buses in the city from 8 am to 10 pm. The Ahmedabad police commissioner had issued a notification in Jan 2022 to restrict the entry of private buses under Section 33 (1) (b) and (c) of the Gujarat Police Act.

In the first ten days of September alone, the state reported over 2,650 cases of dengue, more than 2,150 cases of malaria, and 288 cases of chikungunya. Tragically, two deaths have been linked to dengue during this period. On average, the state is witnessing 265 new dengue cases, 215 malaria cases, and 28 chikungunya cases daily. The pervasive nature of these illnesses has raised concerns, with reports indicating that nearly every household is affected by some form of viral infection or mosquito related disease. In Ahmedabad, from September 1 to 15, a total of 282 dengue cases were reported, including 16 children aged one year or younger. Medical staff combatting dengue Currently, more than 68 dengue cases have been reported among hospital staff at Asarwa Civil hospital, where healthcare workers have raised multiple complaints regarding unsanitary conditions. This negligence has led to serious allegations against hospital administration, as the unhygienic environment has put staff at greater risk for contracting dengue. Doctors and health workers, while attending to patients, have also fallen ill. Civil hospital officials confirmed that over 20 doctors and health workers have contracted dengue, with six currently receiving treatment within the facility. Dengue, Chikungunya, Malaria in Gujarat An analysis of dengue statistics over the past five years reveals a fluctuating trend: 1,564 cases in 2020, 10,983 in 2021, 6,682 in 2022, and 7,222 recorded so far in 2023, with an additional 893 cases noted up to June 2024. In total, the state has seen more than 26,451 dengue cases, resulting in over 30 fatalities. Despite claims of a decrease in cases compared to last year, the current situation remains alarming. The rise in malaria cases is also concerning, with an average of over 210 new cases reported daily, prompting 22 districts to be placed on high alert. While chikungunya cases are lower compared to dengue and malaria, the increasing trend cannot be overlooked. In September, chikungunya cases have seen a notable increase. Currently, government and private hospitals are witnessing a surge in patients suffering from viral infections and mosquito-borne diseases.

Dave has been accused of harassing the 21-year-old student from Papua New Guinea who is residing at the university’s hostel.

Megha Tevar, Superintendent of Police Headquarters Ahmedabad Rural, said, “The following day, Mrudang Dave allegedly threatened the student, warning her not to disclose the incident to anyone. He reportedly told her that if she spoke about it, her life would be in danger.” Fearing for her safety, the student confided in her brother, leading to a formal police complaint.

Several students, she said, have reportedly faced similar harassment. The Bopal police have registered a case of molestation and criminal intimidation against Dave, and an investigation is underway. Authorities are also exploring the possibility of other victims coming forward. “We arrested the accused on Sunday evening.

The pothole, which emerged on June 30, prompted AUDA to issue a public notice on July 9, indicating that the road would be closed for repairs. However, as time has dragged on, the road remains inaccessible, impacting local traffic and daily commutes. In the interim, the alternate ‘VIP Road,’ constructed before the monsoon season, has become heavily congested, with 24-hour traffic flow leading to its deteriorating condition.

Instead of following the Gujarat Common Admission Service (GCAS) portal as directed, the university will conduct its admissions through the ‘Samarth’ portal. Students will now face the challenge of registering on two separate platforms — the Samarth portal for Gujarat University and the GCAS portal for other institutions. This dual registration requirement complicates an already intricate admission process, which typically wraps up by late September following entrance exams held in July. The government has mandated that 11 state universities and 3 other institutions conduct their PhD admissions via the GCAS portal, yet no official announcements regarding this process have been made as September draws to a close. This has left many students uncertain about the timeline for their admissions. Despite requests for subject-wise meeting details from the government, Gujarat University, along with three other universities, did not provide the necessary information. Reports suggest that Gujarat University delayed communication with the government until the last moment before unveiling its own independent admission process. Online registration on the Samarth portal is set to begin on September 26, with the PhD entrance exam scheduled for October 20. The state government insists on a common admission process exclusively through the GCAS portal, with exceptions only for Gujarat Technological University (GTU). As a result, students are required to navigate both registration systems. Previously, the University opted for oral exams for soft skills rather than written tests, contradicting the Standard Operating Procedures outlined by the National Education Policy.

"Builders, leaders accused of collusion to usurp disputed land in Surat’s Rander",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/builders-leaders-accused-of-collusion-to-usurp-disputed-land-in-surats-rander,2024-09-25,25,09,2024,"A land in Surat’s Rander that has been at the centre of controversy over the years, has landed in the court again. The court has ordered that action against two trustees, aged 75 and 82, associated with the land to be halted. It has also rebuked the investigating officer and eco cell inspector. Prominent leaders and the builder lobby are eyeing the land in question, that falls under survey nos 259, 268, 337, and 338, in Rander’s Gorat. They reportedly intend to pass on the land to the police, after taking it away from the trust. Sources believe that the police, eager to appease the leaders, have taken action against the elderly trust members. Former commissioner Ajay Tomar had ordered the filing of the disputed land case. Acting on it, the current commissioner A S Gehlot’s Eco Cell detained the two senior trust members. Timeline of dispute Dating back to 1928, the land was brought under the ownership of the trust to be used for educational purpose. The land belongs to a Waqf fund trust of Fatmabibi and Khatijabi since 1954. The land was also announced as Non-Agricultural (NA) under section 88 (B) of the Gujarat Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act. Despite this, tenant farmers were using the land for agricultural activities at the time, and multiple applications were made to transfer the land to tenant farmers between 1963 and 1965. However, the mamlatdar of the Agriculture, Farmers Welfare and Co-operation Department had rejected it. However, when new revenue records were made in 1971, the tenant farmers were made owners of the land. In 1974-75, the name of the trust was missing from the land records. The land documents claiming ownership of the land with the tenant farmers had the authentication of Bardoli's Agriculture, Farmers Welfare and Co-operation Department in 1971, despite the land located in Rander. Moreover, the department came into existence in 1976, proving that the documents were forged. It is believed that one of the tenants, Nagar Jeevan, who was active in the collector's office as deputy mamlatdar, had forged the ownership in the name of tenant farmers. The trust had applied multiple times to acquire the original ownership document. When they did not receive it, the trust had also filed a petition in the high court.

The operation led to the recovery of eight illegal pistols, 39 cartridges, and assets valued at ₹2.33 lakh. The arrests were made following a raid conducted by the Ahmedabad Rural Special Operations Group (SOG). The accused, identified as Kishore Kumar alias K K Panchal (31), Vismakumar Padhiyar (32), Jagdish Lal alias J K Lohar (32), and Amin Rafik Memon (31), were found in possession of firearms and ammunition without any legal authorisation. The raid also resulted in the seizure of mobile phones and other critical evidence. Investigations revealed that the suspects were connected to an illegal arms network. The key supplier, identified as Mansingh Sikhligar, is still at large, and efforts are underway to apprehend him. The arrested individuals have a long history of criminal involvement, including cases of robbery, theft, and illegal firearm possession. Their activities span Gujarat and Rajasthan, making them notorious figures in the region. Police have filed three separate cases under the Arms Act and the Gujarat Police Act, and further investigations are ongoing to uncover the full extent of the illegal firearms network. In July 2024, Gujarat Police expressed concern over the smuggling of illegal firearms from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Firearms are trafficked from Madhya Pradesh’s districts like Barwani, Khargone, Sangrur, and Bhind to gunrunners in Gujarat. Barrels used to manufacture these illegal 7.62 mm and 7.65 mm pistols in MP are supplied from Surat. On April 4, 2024, the Madhya Pradesh’s Anti-Terrorism Squad raided one individual Sarnam Singh's home in the Prabhunagar area of Surat, uncovering 360 barrels made from the steering shafts of four-wheeler vehicles. During interrogation, Singh admitted to supplying raw materials and barrels for pistol manufacturing in MP. The raid followed a significant crackdown on illegal firearm production in the Khargone district of MP. According to Gujarat ATS, in the past few years, they have seized over 150 semi-automatic country-made pistols and arrested around 60 accused individuals involved in the illegal arms trade. This growing smuggling network has raised concerns about the spread of illicit weapons in the region.

According to the police complaint filed at the Bopal Police Station on September 25, the 21-year-old had disappeared from the trekking camp she’d been attending on December 29, 2023. While she returned to camp around 9 pm that night, her parents — who flew out to meet her on December 30 — noticed burn marks on her arms. When confronted, the young woman confirmed that the burns were from a cigarette. She then told her parents that she had left the camp to meet a man from Pune, with whom she had connected on social media. The man burned her in a fit of anger during a verbal argument during their meet, she said. The 45-year-old complainant told the police that her daughter continued to communicate with the accused via Whatsapp video calls even after returning from Goa, despite her parents’ advice and insistence. “It was like she was under his control,” the woman said. Recently, a relative reached out to the older woman, after the daughter solicited money from them. In another confrontation with her parents, the 21-year-old admitted that the accused was blackmailing her after secretly recording a video of her undressing — at his behest — during a video call. The accused allegedly instructed her to slit her wrists if she could not come up with the money that he had demanded. Desperate to comply, she first asked friends and family for funds.

These individuals, who are already receiving pension, are now earning salaries ranging from ₹1.5 lakh to ₹5 lakh. The university’s decision to prioritise retired officials over qualified youth has raised concerns. Recently, the university issued a circular ordering the removal of over 40 retired employees. Contrasting the circular, the university still appointed retired officials in key administrative positions.

This decision comes amid ongoing hearings in the Gujarat High Court concerning the river’s pollution, prompting the AMC to act in response to environmental concerns. The initiative aims to address pollution caused by 14 different outlets in the city that discharge untreated water into the river. AMC has appointed a panel of firms Greenway Technologies, Bioxgreen Tech Pvt Ltd, Organica Biotech Pvt Ltd , and J M Infra and Enviro Tech Pvt Ltd will be appointed for three years to carry out the work at various locations. Regarding the cleaning in Sabarmati river, committee chairman Dilip Bagaria faced questions regarding the project’s budget and specifics, but he refrained from providing details, stating that the panel’s appointment was the current focus. A budget of ₹75.66 crore has been approved for upgrading the Pirana Sewage Treatment Plant to meet National Green Tribunal standards. The upgrade will include a five year operation and maintenance plan, along with new rising lines at the Vasna treatment facility for bioremediation at an estimated cost of ₹4.32 crore. Bioremediation technology is expected to purify contaminated water at a cost of approximately ₹1,700 per million liters. This innovative approach will involve specific microbes and chemicals to treat sewage before it enters the river, with treated water released 500 meters downstream to effectively cleanse bacteria-laden wastewater. Officials noted that this technology has been successfully employed in the National Clean Ganga Mission, suggesting its potential to enhance the health of the Sabarmati River and improve the overall environmental situation in Ahmedabad.

The ‘Trinetra’ project allows private societies to install CCTV cameras with financial assistance from the police. While residents contribute half of the installation costs from their own funds, the police department is responsible for reimbursing the other half. However, for the past four months, many societies report that their subsidy applications remain in limbo, with no clear explanation for the holdup. Residents of these societies have raised concerns that their files are neglected in the offices of the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) and Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), with allegations of corruption surfacing. “We submitted our files months ago, but it seems like they are just collecting dust,” said a resident of one affected society. “We are beginning to suspect that nothing will move without a bribe.” The total amount of pending subsidies has reached approximately ₹2 crore, causing considerable restlesness among residents who relied on this funding for their security enhancements.

It’s essential for me to look at feedback; it will only make me a better person, a better entrepreneur, and a better Indian,” Nanda said. “I think we need to take critical feedback in the correct way. I accept that I come from a very different lived reality to most people in India today, and I come from a privileged background. I have been given a lot more opportunities than people my age so, people will have something to say about that,” she added.

"Can police lodge FIR in tax evasion case, questions Gujarat HC",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/can-police-lodge-fir-in-tax-evasion-case-questions-guj-hc,2024-09-27,27,09,2024,"Gujarat High Court has posed a critical question to the state government regarding the filing of police complaints in cases of income tax evasion. “Can the police register a First Information Report (FIR) for tax evasion, or is the Income Tax (I-T Department) the appropriate authority for necessary proceedings?” inquired the court. Justice Nirzar Desai’s probing question left the government in a sport, as it struggled to provide a satisfactory explanation. In light of the lack of clarity from the government, Justice Desai issued a notice to both the state government and the CID Crime in Gandhinagar, prohibiting any action by the authorities. However, the High Court has allowed the investigation to continue. The state government and CID Crime have been notified, and a stay has been placed on any punitive action while the investigation is ongoing. In a petition seeking to quash the police complaint regarding tax evasion, the legal issue presented was that the police should not be allowed to register complaints in such cases, as the authority lies solely with the I-T Department. The petitioners argued that proceedings against them were already initiated by the I-T Department, so it was inappropriate for the police to file a complaint on the same matter. The petitioners drew the court’s attention to the fact that the police had filed a complaint against them under various sections of the IPC, including 420, 409, 465, 467, 471, and 120(B), as well as under various provisions of the Income Tax Act. They contended that the police had wrongfully registered the complaint, asserting that only the I-T Department is authorised to take action in cases of tax evasion. They highlighted that no complaint had been lodged by the I-T Department itself, raising the question of how the police could proceed in such a manner. During the hearing, Justice Desai reprimanded the government, questioning, “If the police will file complaints for tax evasion, what is the purpose of the I-T Department?” He further asked, “If you are doing the I-T Department’s job, what will they do?” The court pointed out that the FIR in question was based on a report from the I-T Department.

Vastrapur police has filed a case against unknown persons in the case. Nilesh Hiralal Marwadi, 26, a resident of the Thaltej area, works as a petrol filler at Mahadev Petrol Pump, located near the Drive-in Cinema. On the evening of September 1, around 6 pm, Nilesh was on duty when two unidentified women arrived at the pump on a moped to refuel. One of the women was talking on her phone while the other stood near the vehicle. Citing safety precautions, Nilesh requested the woman to end the phone call, as the use of mobile phones is prohibited at petrol pumps due to safety concerns. The request, however, sparked an argument. The two women became enraged and began shouting, and verbally abusing Nilesh. As the situation escalated, Nilesh chose to ignore the confrontation and continued with his work. The women eventually left the petrol pump. Later that evening, around 8.30 pm, the duo returned to the petrol pump, accompanied by three male associates. They arrived in two vehicles — a white Hyundai Creta and a black Ford Endeavour. The group entered the premises and physically assaulted Nilesh. He sustained injuries in the attack before the petrol pump supervisor intervened. The police have recovered CCTV footage from the petrol pump to aid in identifying the suspects and pursuing legal action.

According to the police, Vasani had collected the cash from an Angadia firm near Seema Hall in the Prahladnagar area. While driving along the road behind Shalby Hospital, a biker approached his car and pointed out that his vehicle had a punctured tyre before speeding off. Vasani initially ignored the warning and continued driving. Moments later, another biker flagged him down, reiterating that his rear tyre was punctured. Upon hearing this for the second time, Vasani pulled over to the side of the road to inspect the tyre. He locked his car and left a bag containing ₹40 lakh in cash on the front passenger seat. After confirming the tyre was indeed punctured, he began to change it with a spare wheel. Unbeknownst to him, one of the bikers returned, broke the car’s lock, and stole the bag with the cash before fleeing the scene.

As per the complaint, the accused lured the victims with promises of government jobs and also provided fake appointment letters to gain their trust. The accused demanded ₹1 crore to ₹1.25 crore per position. The Ahmedabad Crime Branch has initiated legal proceedings, and further investigation has revealed the possibility that the accused may have similarly defrauded others. The victims were given counterfeit appointment letters to create trust. Police believe more revelations may emerge as the investigation proceeds. As per the case details, Yogeshbhai Patel, a resident of Krish Exotica Apartments in Nikol, filed the complaint with the Crime Branch. He met one Jitendra Prajapati four years ago when seeking admission to an LLB course at his office in Mirzapur’s Kama Commercial Complex. During this time, he was introduced to Jaldeep Tailor, who claimed to be a lawyer with close ties to high-ranking government officials capable of securing government jobs through GPSC. Jaldeep told Yogeshbhai that a vacancy for Deputy Collector in Ahmedabad was available and offered to arrange the appointment for a payment of ₹1.25 crore, requiring ₹1.15 crore upfront and the remaining amount once the job was secured. Yogeshbhai agreed and paid ₹5 lakh as a client fee to begin the process. Shortly afterwards, Jaldeep and his associate Hitesh Saini took ₹16 lakh from Yogeshbhai, promising an appointment as Deputy Collector within ten days. They even provided a letter signed by the GPSC Secretary to reinforce the legitimacy of their claim. In total, Yogeshbhai paid ₹1.19 crore before realising the scam, as no job materialised. Jaldeep also convinced Yogeshbhai to recommend others, leading to further fraudulent deals. Additionally, Yogeshbhai’s business partner, Vijaybhai Thakkar, was also defrauded of ₹1.20 crore after being promised a Deputy Collector position in Vadodara. Similarly, Ankit Patel paid ₹5 lakh after being offered an Assistant Manager's post at GMDC, with a deal amounting to ₹2 crore. Atul Patel was promised a Joint Director post in Gandhinagar, for which ₹1.20 crore was agreed upon, of which ₹22 lakh was paid. However, all victims received fake appointment letters. In another instance, the accused collected ₹3 lakh as a fee for obtaining a gun licence, falsely assuring that the appointments would be finalised once the licence was issued. They continued to give false assurances by citing reasons such as the Lok Sabha elections to delay the process. The accused even took the victims to meet two individuals, Gaameti and Ankit Pandya, in Gandhinagar to further reinforce the legitimacy of their promises. Once it was discovered that the appointment letters were fraudulent, a formal complaint was lodged with the Crime Branch, leading to charges being filed against Jaldeep Tailor, Hitesh Saini, Jitendra Prajapati, and Ankit Pandya. Crime Branch InspectorJ H Sindhav said, “We have arrested all four accused in the matter and further investigation is on.”",ahmedabad

They made off with ₹1.60 crore worth of gold (2,100 grams) by providing counterfeit ₹500 notes. Mehul Thakkar, a bullion trader based in Manek Chowk, Ahmedabad, received a call from Prashant Patel, the manager of Lakshmi Jewellers, on September 23. Patel informed Thakkar that a client needed to purchase 2,100 grams of gold directly. They agreed on a price of ₹1.60 crore. Subsequently, Patel informed Thakkar that the client couldn't transfer the funds via RTGS immediately, but would provide ₹1.60 crore in cash as security and would transfer the same amount the next day through RTGS. The following day, the client requested an urgent delivery of the gold. Thakkar sent an employee with the gold to the office courier located in Anand Mangal Complex on CG Road. At the location, three individuals were present: two were there to collect the gold, and one was operating a cash  counting machine. The employee was shown bundles of ₹500 notes wrapped in transparent plastic, which they claimed amounted to ₹1.30 crore. They assured the employee that the remaining ₹30 crore would be brought shortly. The employee handed over the gold, believing he was getting paid. One of the con artists claimed he needed to step out to fetch the additional cash, while another excused himself to go to the bathroom. The employee was instructed to count the money after the plastic covering was removed. However, upon checking, it was found that all the ₹500 notes were counterfeit. Upon questioning the person who brought the cash counting machine, it was discovered that he was in the business of renting out such machines. Realising he had been duped, the employee informed Thakkar immediately, and he reported the incident to the Navrangpura police. Navrangpura Police Inspector N N Desai confirmed that the con artists had meticulously planned the scheme, including setting up a fake office and using counterfeit notes in large quantities.

These teams will switch out their khaki uniforms for traditional Navratri attire to blend in with festive crowds while maintaining vigilance. “Our goal is to ensure that women feel safe and protected while enjoying the festivities,” Joshi said, adding that the teams will focus on high-traffic areas, with deployment based on crowd density in different zones. ""The area will be designated based on the maximum crowd, but it will be a moving bandobast rather than a stagnant one so that our team can cover as much of the city as possible,” Joshi said. Other measures are also being taken to foster a balance between the festive spirit and vigilance. The Mahila Crime Branch will keep a close watch on the 181 women’s helpline to provide swift responses to distress calls, and a She Squad from every police station in the city will patrol and maintain security in their respective area for the duration of the festival. The police are also putting the onus of enjoying the festival responsibly on the public. Videos providing essential safety tips and precautions for women will be shared on social media and screened at major venues. These will “remind the public to respect others' enjoyment and avoid any disruptive behaviour,” Joshi said. “Everyone has the right to enjoy the festival; they also have a duty to ensure that their actions do not affect the enjoyment of others.”",ahmedabad

These directives include conducting criminal background checks, requiring declarations of simultaneous degrees or employment, and ensuring compliance with attendance norms before candidates are enrolled for legal practice. Students are required to disclose any ongoing FIRs or criminal cases against them. Moreover, if a student fails to disclose facts, their mark sheets and degrees will be withheld. Anil Kella, the former chairperson of the Gujarat Bar Council and finance committee, stated that as per directive from the BCI, the state bar council of each state must ensure that candidates wishing to register have strictly adhered to the prescribed instructions. Candidates will be required to declare any concurrent degree programmes, regular educational programmes, or employment status during their legal education. The bar council must also verify that candidates have met all the requirements of the BCI’'s rules and regulations, including mandatory attendance. Approval for dual degree All state bar councils across the country must also ensure that candidates have complied with the instructions before registration. Strict directives have been issued to all state bar councils to refrain from registering any candidates until complete adherence to these measures, which have been established to maintain the quality and integrity of legal education and ensure candidates meet the high standards expected of legal professionals. Additionally, institutions providing dual degrees with foreign universities must obtain prior approval from the BCI. A dual degree programme refers to an arrangement where a student obtains two distinct degrees from two different institutions, typically in two different jurisdictions, while a joint degree programme includes a degree offered jointly by two or more institutions. The BCI has mandated that prior approval is necessary for any such dual or joint degree programmes between Indian law institutions and foreign universities. Law colleges will be required to ensure all these responsibilities are met, including retaining CCTV footage and recordings for one year. Directives have also been issued to implement a biometric system to ensure the mandatory attendance requirements for law students are fulfilled. No more fake lawyers Previously, the Supreme Court expressed serious concerns regarding the infiltration of fake lawyers in the legal field. The Supreme Court has strongly advocated for the establishment of high standards of quality and excellence in legal education, as well as the legal profession. It has also directed the implementation of processes, including verification.

AMC prepares SOP to blacklist contractors,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/amc-prepares-sop-to-blacklist-contractors,2024-09-29,29,09,2024,"The municipal commissioner of Ahmedabad has issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) regarding blacklisting of contractors in tenders and contracts issued by the AMC. The SOP will be implemented after approval from the legal committee. In many cases where the delay in action according to the rules and regulations of different departments leads to arbitrations, AMC bears the losses if the judgements are against the department. Tenders and contracts are carried out for various projects in AMC. However, in cases where the AMC wants to blacklist a contractor over non-performance or other reasons, the contractors go to arbitration against the corporation. This sometimes leads to arbitrators' adverse judgments against the AMC. Cases also take a long time to reach a verdict, holding the projects in their timelines. The costs of the system also increase on the system due to these reasons. To avoid such situations, the municipal commissioner prepared an elaborate SOP on September 24, pending approval from the corporation's legal committee. How does arbitration work? According to the standard provisions of the Central Vigilance Commission, if there is a dispute in any tender or contract, one arbitrator is appointed by the contractor and one arbitrator by the government. These two arbitrators appoint another arbitrator to ensure that all decisions do not go in favour of the government according to the principle of natural justice. In disputed cases, the award or decision given by the arbitrator has to be accepted by the contractor and the government.

Event organisers have been directed to install their own cameras at venues, focusing particularly on entry and exit points to strengthen security. Ajay Kumar Chaudhary, Special Commissioner of Ahmedabad, emphasised the city's commitment to safety, stating, ""More than 3,000 cameras will monitor Ahmedabad's Navratri nights, ensuring that public spaces across the city are under surveillance. In addition, 20 portable cameras equipped with 3D mapping and artificial intelligence (AI) technology will enhance our ability to keep the city safe.” In a coordinated effort, local police stations have been instructed to identify dark spots and blind spots in their respective areas. Temporary CCTV cameras will be installed in these isolated locations to ensure continuous coverage during the festival nights. Himala Joshi, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) of the Mahila Crime Branch, highlighted the importance of thorough surveillance, “The safety of the public during these festive nights is our top priority. We have instructed organisers to cover their entire venues with surveillance, particularly at the main entry and exit points.” Taking a technological leap, the Ahmedabad Police will utilise 3D mapping and AI technology to enhance their surveillance capabilities and improve incident response times. This cutting-edge technology will allow for real-time detection of disturbances, suspicious activity, or any potential safety concerns. In addition, mobile cameras in police vehicles and pocket cameras carried by officers will provide on-the-ground coverage of high-traffic areas throughout the city.",ahmedabad

A Bopal resident filed a complaint against Nitin Patel and Vijaya Sawle of Pacific Relocation Services in Makarba. As per her complaint to the Sarkhej Police, the woman was asked of ₹45 lakh for a skill-based visa to Canada. However, she had denied it stating the lack of funds as the reason. Later, one of the employees from the same firm approached her, offering to reduce the amount to ₹30 lakh. They asked her to pay half the amount when the passport is ready and half whenever she starts earning in Canada. Later, Patel offered to forge her Class 12 marksheet, which she also refused. However, one of the staff mentioned that they had already sent someone to Canada with a fake certificate, and Sawle, who lives in Canada, had also gone there through a similar process. They reassured her that she would not face any legal issues, after which she decided to hand over her documents and passport for processing. Sawle took two cheques amounting to ₹4 lakh from the woman, assuring her that they wouldn’t be deposited in the bank. The complainant also paid ₹4 lakh in cash. The complainant, however, then decided to not proceed further with her application and demanded her money and documents back. Upon this, the accused threatened to file a case of bounced cheque against her. This prompted the complainant to approach Sarkhej police, who have started an investigation into this matter.

The Ahmedabad Crime Branch continues to probe this scam, seeking to identify additional victims, as it is believed that over 50 youths may have been duped. The crime branch requested for a 10-day remand to delve deeper into the operations of the accused and the scale of the fraud. During the probe at offices in Vatva, Madhupura, Maninagar, and Mirzapur, police discovered around 50 files, suggesting that candidates were lured with promises of posting in various government departments. The accused lured the victims with promises of government jobs and provided fake appointment letters to gain their trust. They demanded between ₹1 crore and ₹1.25 crore per position. According to the complaint, Yogesh Patel had met Jaldeep Tailor, the main accused, via a friend named Jitendra Prajapati. Tailor claimed of having connections with the Gujarat Public Service Commission (GPSC) and high ranking government officials. He informed Patel about a vacancy in the Deputy Collector’s office, requiring a payment of ₹1.25 crore for the position. Yogesh initially paid ₹5 lakh as a client fee and was soon asked for an additional ₹16 lakh, with promises of an appointment within ten days, supported by a fake letter signed by the GPSC Secretary. In total, he paid ₹1.19 crore before realising it was a scam, as no job materialised. Patel’s business partner, Vijaybhai Thakkar, was also defrauded of ₹1.20 crore under similar pretences, while Ankit Patel lost ₹5 lakh for an Assistant Manager position at GMDC, and Atul Patel paid ₹22 lakh for a promised Joint Director role in Gandhinagar, all receiving fake appointment letters.

Despite fees being collected for the recruitment tests, the hiring has been unexpectedly suspended. The recruitment process at Gujarat University has been in limbo for over two years, causing frustration among thousands of candidates who applied for various posts. A recruitment drive for teaching and non-teaching staff was announced in October 2022 during the previous vice-chancellor’s tenure, with plans to fill 92 junior clerk positions, 28 Class-1 officer posts, and over 40 teaching positions. Since the arrival of the new vice-chancellor in June 2023, there has been no resumption of the pending recruitment. Despite over a year passing since the introduction of the new Common University Act, candidates are still waiting for updates. In September 2022, applications were invited for various positions, including 92 junior clerks, chief accountants, librarians, press managers, estate engineers, deputy registrars, physical education directors, and scientific officers, among others. The recruitment process initiated for over 40 teaching positions, including 23 assistant professors and 20 associate professors, has also stalled. Concerns have been raised regarding the handling of recruitment within different departments. While positions offering salaries between ₹10,000 and ₹60,000 are advertised and interviews conducted, higher-level posts, such as directors and officer positions, are often filled temporarily by in-charge officials . As the new vice-chancellor marks 15 months in office, the lack of progress in the recruitment process remains a significant issue.

Gujarat sees fivefold increase in platelet demand due to rise in dengue cases,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/rise-in-dengue-cases-triggers-fivefold-increase-in-platelet-demand-in-gujarat,2024-09-30,30,09,2024,"As dengue cases continue to rise in Gujarat, the demand for platelets has surged dramatically. Currently, an average of 16 new cases are reported daily, with Ahmedabad alone recording 700 dengue cases in a month. This alarming trend has placed immense pressure on blood donation centres, where platelet demand has escalated from 30 to 150 units in just one month. Dr Vishwas Amin from the Indian Red Cross Society noted, a month ago, the supply of platelets ranged from 30 to 40 units. However, this number has now skyrocketed to between 100 and 150 units as the community grapples with the increase in dengue infections. The period from January to September has shown a surge in platelet demand, which is critical for treating patients suffering from dengue fever. Why are platelets crucial for dengue patients? Platelets are essential components of blood that help in clotting and are vital for patients battling dengue, a disease that can cause a significant drop in platelet counts. A decrease in platelets can lead to serious complications, making timely access to these life-saving components crucial. A call to action for blood donations In light of this situation, it is imperative that blood donation efforts ramp up during the festival season. Ensuring a steady supply of platelets is essential for the health and safety of those affected by dengue.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah will preside over the opening of the seven-story building, marking a significant milestone in the city's law enforcement infrastructure. Features The new facility is designed to meet 21st-century law enforcement needs: Public-centric design: The ground and first floors house public-oriented offices, including passport services, public applications, special branches, and offices for student certificates. Technological marvel: Five control rooms, including two large CCTV video wall setups, will monitor citywide activities. Advanced facial and vehicle recognition systems are expected to be useful in tracking individuals or vehicles involved in any crime. Sustainable operations: The centrally air-conditioned office will be equipped with solar panels. Comprehensive facilities: The building features spacious underground parking and two cafeterias — one for the public and one for police employees and officers. Security measures: The entire office will be covered by CCTV. History The new headquarters, rising from the historic grounds of Shahibaug, represents a dramatic evolution from its humble beginnings. In 1960, as the Maha Gujarat Andolan drew to a close, Ahmedabad established its first police commissionerate under Commissioner Niranjan Das. The original office, repurposed from a Parsi-run eye hospital, has served as the nerve centre of city policing for over six decades. The eye hospital, once located on the outskirts of the city and surrounded by fields, is now situated in a busy, urban area. The windows next to the control room, now the entrance to the police commissioner's office, used to be the windows for patients to collect their case papers. The office has undergone minor changes over time, from 1960 to 2024. Currently, Ahmedabad has its 38th Police Commissioner, Gyanendra Singh Malik, who replaced IPS Prem Vir Singh in 2023. As the city grows and evolves, so too does its approach to law enforcement. The new police commissionerate stands as a bridge between Ahmedabad's rich history and its future, representing the city's commitment to modern, efficient law enforcement.

This wide range of sources will provide the department with insights into online activity that may impact the city’s security. The software is equipped with advanced capabilities, including the ability to analyse data based on emotional distribution, document classification, language detection, top hashtags, and trending themes. By using natural language processing (NLP) and named entity recognition (NER), the tool will help criminal intelligence analysts identify hidden connections, crime patterns, and emerging trends.

With the opening of new routes and increasing number of passengers, the loss is expected to reduce in the coming years. The Metro Rail has now become a ‘lifeline’ for many citizens. Compared to two-wheelers, Metro travel saves 35 to 40 minutes and up to ₹50 in expenses, suggest sources. On the East-West corridor, the distance from Vastral village to Thaltej is approximately 26 kilometres by vehicle. By metro, it will only cost₹1 per km. According to GMRC sources, from October 2022 to August 2024, the Metro carried an average of 72,514 passengers daily, generating revenue of ₹8.88 lakh. From January to August this year, 2.31 crore passengers travelled via Metro, generating ₹27.47 crore in revenue, compared to 2.53 crore passengers recorded last year. Highest income in past 2 years Month Revenue Passengers May 2024 ₹4.23 crore 31.22 lakh July 2024 ₹3.77 crore 32.15 lakh August 2024 ₹3.72 crore 31.75 lakh April 2024 ₹3.49 crore 28.5 lakh While the Metro Rail has become a lifeline for many, there are still shortcomings: Parking: There is a lack of parking facilities near Metro stations, forcing many commuters to opt for their vehicles instead of the Metro. Connectivity: A proper feeder connectivity also refrains many people from using the Metro. If public transport facilities were available at other locations near Metro stations, the number of passengers could increase. Recently, partial route of the Motera to Mahatma Mandir corridor was inaugurated on September 16. Nearly 56,000 passengers travelled between Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar by Metro in just two weeks. The 20.8 km long corridor of Phase 2 of the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar Metro Rail project garnered a great response from people. This network connects GNLU, PDEU, GIFT City and Gandhinagar’s Sector-1.

The duo scammed an electrician of ₹36,000 by posing as police officers, and falsely accusing him of being wanted in a drugs case. When Ramesh Dangar, 33, was heading towards Science City’s Sopan Society for an electrical job on his two-wheeler around 3 pm on September 23, two men stopped him and made him park his vehicle by the roadside. They introduced themselves as police officers and started shouting at Dangar, accusing him of being wanted in an Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) case. One of them even assaulted him and threatened to take him to the police station unless he paid a hefty sum to 'erase' his name from the case. A panic-stricken Dangar handed over ₹36,000 that he was carrying to the duo. The impostor duo then demanded another ₹50,000. To fulfil their demand, they took Dangar to an HDFC ATM on Science City Road to withdraw the said amount. Meanwhile, upon reaching the ATM, Dangar noticed that their vehicle had no number plate, and suspected foul play. To evade losing more money, Dangar deliberately entered the wrong PIN at the ATM, causing his card to be blocked. Frustrated by their failed attempt, the fraudsters decided to take Dangar to a petrol pump near Gota Bridge, where he’d transfer money via UPI to the petrol pump’s account, and they would collect cash from there. However, while conversing with the petrol pump staff, Dangar managed to escape the accused’s captivity and headed straight to a nearby traffic police station. Seeing Dangar heading towards the police station, the two fled the scene as well. Dangar filed a complaint on October 1, following which the case was handed over to the Ahmedabad City Crime Branch. Based on CCTV footage from the areas where the extortion took place, two suspects were detained today. Also read: Ahmedabad police nabs fake cops extorting money near Ognaj Ring Road",ahmedabad

The accused, who allegedly downloaded explicit videos of the victim, defamed her, and physically abused her during a video call, was apprehended this afternoon after police tracked him down to Pune, where he operated a small business. According to Om Prakash Jat, Superintendent of Police Ahmedabad Rural “Sahil had met the victim through social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, and WhatsApp, exploiting these connections to manipulate and extort money from her.Sahil forced the girl to undress during a video call and used the video to blackmail her, threatening to release the video if she did not comply with his demands.” The case came to light when the victim’s family, residents of a prominent Ahmedabad neighbourhood, noticed unusual behaviour in their daughter. Her trauma reportedly began after a trekking camp in Goa last Christmas, where she had met Sahil. Upon her return, her phone had been switched off, and she was found with burn marks on her hands, inflicted by Sahil during their meeting in Goa. The victim disclosed that Sahil had physically abused her by burning her with a cigarette. Back in Ahmedabad, Sahil’s harassment escalated. He repeatedly blackmailed the girl, sending her QR codes and demanding money to prevent the release of her private videos. The girl, desperate to keep the situation under control, had to ask her relatives to transfer funds to Sahil. His control over her extended to her social media accounts, including WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Instagram, leaving her further vulnerable to his manipulation. After the family lodged a police complaint in Bopal, authorities quickly launched an investigation that led them to Pune, where Sahil was apprehended. Police reports indicate that Sahil had been systematically extorting money from the victim for months, exploiting her fear and control over her personal data. “A total of ₹90,000 was extorted from the girl during a 6-month duration. We suspect there are more victims. It was also revealed during questioning that the accused got the girl’s contact from her classmate when she was studying in Pune,” Jat added.",ahmedabad

Takhatsinh, a security guard at a party plot in Bodakdev, was struck by an SUV when he was riding to his work on a bicycle. The incident occurred around 10 am on October 1, resulting in Takhatsinh’s death on the spot. Eyewitnesses quickly apprehended the jeep driver, identified as Gopalsinh, and handed him over to the N Division Police Station. Initially registered as a road accident, the case took a turn when suspicion arose due to the shared Rajasthan origins of both the victim and the driver. Upon reviewing CCTV footage, police discovered that Gopalsinh had been waiting for Takhatsinh and deliberately rammed into him. The lack of remorse on Gopalsinh’s face further fuelled suspicion, prompting a deeper investigation. During interrogation, Gopalsinh revealed a shocking motive, a 22-year-old revenge. In 2002, a quarrel between Harisinh, Gopalsinh’s father, and Takhatsinh in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, led to Takhatsinh running over Harisinh with an SUV. Takhatsinh was sentenced to jail for the incident. After serving his sentence, he moved to Ahmedabad three years ago, fearing that he would be killed in Rajasthan. Determined to avenge his father’s death, Gopalsinh meticulously planned the murder. He purchased a Bolero from Deesa three days prior and conducted a full recce of the area. On the morning of October 1, he executed his plan in the same manner as his father had been killed by Takhatsinh years earlier. The police had initially registered a road accident case which now has been reclassified into a murder case. Further investigation is on.
