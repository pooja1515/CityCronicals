This initiative was highlighted in a pivotal meeting held at a private hotel in Rajkot, chaired by minister of state for home affairs, Harsh Sanghvi, shared the party sources. The meeting saw the participation of prominent Kshatriya leaders from the BJP, including influential figures from Rajkot and Jamnagar such as Jayrajsinh Jadeja, Kesridevsinh Zala, Narendrasinh Jadeja, Virendrasinh Zala, and Narendrasinh Zala of Morbi, alongside Rajbha from Gondal. Discussions focussed on the community’s unrest following remarks against the Maharajas by union minister, Parshottam Rupala, which sparked widespread dissatisfaction among the Kshatriyas. On Apr 20, the Kshatriya Rajput community’s coordination committee outlined a campaign strategy against BJP leader Rupala and the party at large. This includes organising booth-level campaigns across every village and city to ensure a substantial turnout of votes against the BJP by May 7, the polling day in Gujarat. In a shift from conventional protest tactics, the community announced plans to hold public demonstrations across 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat, prominently featuring saffron flags. Additionally, the community intends to support competent candidates from other parties, operating under the maxim, “The enemy’s enemy is our friend.” The committee is also planning village-to-village meetings to amplify their message to rally further support. In a symbolic gesture, community women will conduct a one-day fast in each district, marking their protest against Rupala’s candidature. Various social organisations within each district are promoting a disciplined and coordinated approach to voting against the BJP. Furthermore, starting from Apr 22, Dharmaraths or chariots bearing religious insignia will traverse five zones of Gujarat, originating from religious sites to educate villagers on the importance of voting against the BJP. The movement gained momentum on Apr 14 when over 1.5 lakh community members from Gujarat and neighbouring states convened in Rajkot, demanding the withdrawal of Rupala’s nomination for the Rajkot Lok Sabha seat.

Kshatriya community’s influence reshaping Gujarat’s Lok Sabha elections,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/kshatriya-communitys-influence-reshaping-gujarats-lok-sabha-elections,2024-05-06,6,05,2024,"Parshottam Rupala The Lok Sabha elections in Gujarat have been marked by the Kshatriya community’s tumultuous display of power and determination. The protests against alleged derogatory remarks by union minister Parshottam Rupala, who is the BJP’s Rajkot candidate, have evolved into a formidable force shaping Gujarat’s political landscape. During a Dalit community function in Rajkot on Mar 2, BJP leader Rupala stated that while Dalits had shown unwavering dedication, Rajputs/Kshatriyas shared meals and married their daughters to heretics. Rupala is a Patel, and his remarks on the Kshatriya community added fuel to the fire. Kshatriyas and Patels are two important communities that influence Gujarat’s politics. Given the “roti-beti vyavhar” comment by Rupala, the Kshatriya community organised itself, forming a coordination committee comprising 92 organisations across Gujarat. Their demand for the withdrawal of minister Rupala’s candidature went unheeded by the BJP, leading to escalated protests and disruptions in the BJP candidates’ campaigns in Kshatriya-dominated areas. The Kshatriya community constitutes approximately 70 lakh or 10% of Gujarat’s total population. This demographic strength has considerable influence over electoral outcomes, particularly in key constituencies like Jamnagar, Rajkot, Surendranagar, Bhavnagar, Kutch, Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Anand, and Bharuch. Despite apologies from Rupala and other party leaders, the BJP stood firm, prompting a shift in the Kshatriya community’s stance. Kshatriya agitation’s implications on Gujarat’s Lok Sabha dynamics Initially targeting Rupala, they now pledge to vote against the BJP on all 25 Lok Sabha and five assembly seats in Gujarat, signalling a significant challenge for the ruling party. In response to a senior Kshatriya leader’s appeal for forgiving the BJP, the community’s coordination committee reinforced its resolve on May 5, urging Rajputs to uphold their commitment to voting against the BJP over the Rupala controversy. Karansinh Chavda of the Kshatriya coordination committee emphasised, “This is a battle of ego versus pride. We aim to achieve 100% anti-BJP voting across all 25 Lok Sabha and five assembly seats. Our non-violent protests were ignored. The BJP’s leaders continue to make divisive remarks without apology. This lack of accountability is unacceptable. Our protests will extend beyond this issue. We will demonstrate our influence in future district and panchayat elections, impacting 10-12 seats and significantly influencing local bodies.” Congress places its bet on Paresh Dhanani Gujarat Congress leader Paresh Dhanani is the candidate for the Rajkot seat against senior BJP leader Rupala. This decision of the Kshatriyas has elevated the importance of the Rajkot constituency in Gujarat’s political landscape. Their move is noteworthy as Dhanani has a history of defeating Rupala, having triumphed over him in the 2002 assembly elections for the Amreli constituency. Drawing a parallel to the disrobing of Draupadi in the Mahabharata, Dhanani emphasised the perceived insult felt by the Kshatriya community due to Rupala’s comments.

The officials responsible for issuing these certificates are now absconding. The fire reportedly started due to a welding spark on a ladder. With only one staircase available, people on the second and third floors were trapped, leading to a higher casualty rate.

We are facing difficulty in the firefighting operation because the temporary structure has collapsed and also due to the wind velocity.” Rajkot District Collector Prabhav Joshi said, “The firefighters managed to control the fire, but fumes are still emanating from the debris, and we fear more people could be trapped beneath.” Sources said the owner of the amusement park has been arrested. The place was inundated with crowds because of the weekend. The intensity of the fire was so fierce that smoke was seen billowing from the shopping mall from a long distance. The state government has announced a compensation package of ₹4 lakh each for the next of kin of the deceased and ₹50,000 for every injured person. PM Modi, CM Patel, Amit Shah reacts Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel expressed his condolences and assured swift action. In a post on X, he said, “The state government will provide ₹4 lakh to the families of the deceased and ₹50,000 to the injured. In this regard, a Special Investigation Team has been formed and assigned to investigate the incident. “Instructions have been given to the Municipal Corporation and the administration for immediate rescue and relief operations in the fire incident in the game zone in Rajkot. It has been instructed to prioritise arrangements for immediate treatment of the injured.” Expressing grief over the tragic incident, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X: “Extremely distressed by the fire mishap in Rajkot. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. Prayers for the injured. The local administration is working to provide all possible assistance to those affected.” “The fire tragedy in Rajkot has saddened us all. In my telephone conversation with him a short while ago, Gujarat CM Bhupendrabhai Patel Ji told me about the efforts underway to ensure all possible assistance is provided to those who have been affected,” the Prime Minister said in another post. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, “I am deeply saddened by the accident that happened in the game zone of Rajkot (Gujarat).

However, the negligence of the authorities, where a blind eye of the system led to the horrific incident, is glaring. Turns out, the game zone that has been operational for the last four years did not have a fire non-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department, indicating that there were no means to tackle such an incident in the game zone spanning over 2000 square metres. With such non-compliance with the safety norms, the game zone was allowed to run for four years under the nose of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation and city police. The game zone, a huge two-storied dome reportedly had no ventilation. The investigation on the site today revealed some fire-safety equipment on the site, however, they were in a brand-new, sealed condition. Moreover, the structure of the dome was temporary, and it was filled with flammable materials. Under the general construction and development rules, the plans for a cement and concrete structure have to be approved by the authorities, however, there are no such provisions for the temporary structures like the dome at the TRP game zone. This loophole is known to be exploited by many entities. Adding to the tragedy was the bottlenecking of people when the fire broke out. For such a huge crowd on the weekend, where tickets for the game zone were available at a discount, the organisers had reportedly only kept one gate for the entry and the exit, leading to chaos when the fire broke out.",rajkot

Now, based on suo motu action from the Gujarat High Court, the government has suspended six officers with immediate effect.

Set up under Section 25 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC, now replaced with the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Act), the directorate of prosecution monitors and controls how criminal cases are prosecuted. Led by director Jagroopsinh Rajput in Gujarat, its aim is to ensure justice for victims, greater punishment for convicts and fool proof investigations.

What were the initial measures taken to prevent the fire from spreading? How did the game zone engulfed in flames within 30 minutes? The reason behind the inferno at the game was revealed via CCTV footage, showing the initial moments of the disaster. The video depicted a spark originating from welding work in the extension area, igniting plywood and wooden sheets, fueling the blaze. Efforts to placate the blaze failed despite using available fire extinguishers. The workers involved in the repairing work tried to prevent the fire but due to the absence of a robust fire safety system, the spread of fire was inevitable. Gujarat High Court The Gujarat High Court had taken cognizance of the incident and sought reports from the game zones established in the state’s four major cities - Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, and Surat. The municipal corporations of these four cities will file reports in the high court today. Chief Justice Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai will hear the case.

Moreover, the HC has instructed all the municipal commissioners to conduct a legal audit of the gaming zones within their jurisdictions and ensure compliance with regulations and safety standards. The HC has also issued notice to chief fire officers of all municipal corporations to review fire safety issues. The state government has also assured the HC in this regard. Furthermore, the High Court has sought clarification on various aspects such as adherence to Comprehensive General Development Control Regulations (CGDCR) regulations, acquisition of NOCs from fire authorities, and structural stability of constructions within the gaming zones. The court also asked whether a legal licence has also been obtained from the concerned district collector and mamlatdar under the Gujarat Police Act, Entertainment Tax Act etc. The High Court said that three years after the opening of the TRP game zone in June 2021, it had applied to the RMC to regularise the construction (a fabricated steel frame structure with steel sheet walls) under the provisions of the GRUDA Act (The Gujarat Regularization of Unauthorised Development Act, 2022). Advocate Amit Panchal and Additional Advocate General Mitesh Amin pointed out to the High Court that according to Section-8 and Sub-section-3 of the GRUDA Act, if the provisions of the Gujarat Fire Prevention and Life Safety Messrs Act-2013 are not fulfilled, then its illegal construction cannot be regularised. The High Court order also clarified that the structure of the TRP game zone cannot be termed as a temporary structure as the court considered the definition of building and temporary structure specified in the Act.

The SIT interrogated a total of six personnel belonging to police, fire, and municipal corporation at Gandhinagar Police Bhavan. Three personnel from the police and three from the fire department were summoned by the SIT. As per sources, the officials were responsible for the inspection of the game zone and they accepted their lapse. Legal actions will be taken against those who were responsible. Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP crime) Parthrajsinh Gohil of SIT said, “We are probing four accused linked with the Rajkot game zone fire tragedy”. These four accused have been in police remand for 13 days: 1. Former Assistant Town Planner Mukesh Makwana 2. Former Assistant Town Planner Gautam Joshi (allegedly did not destroy illegal construction) 3. Manoj Sagathiya (allegedly neglected illegal construction) 4.

The SIT formed by the state government has also interrogated Indian Police Service (IPS) officers involved in the licensing procedure. Sources of the SIT team said that the police had given permission only for the ticket booking licence under Section 33 (X) of the Gujarat Police Act, 1951. The licence was the same one that is handed out for the ticket bookings in events such as circuses. Passing the buck In 2021, approval of a ticket booking licence was sought in Rajkot taluka police station in the name of Dhaval Corporation. At that time there was no construction on the site, only a go-karting field. Permission was sought for go-karting and parking in the open space, which was granted by the police. Later in 2023, a renewal application was filed which was also granted by the police after checking any incidents that happened in the past and checking the criminal records of the licensee. At that time, the police addressed a letter to the fire department and asked them to look into the related work. Similarly, Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (PGVCL) issued the power metre after seeing the rent agreement and related documents as per rules. No fire NOC was taken into consideration at that time. The Roads and Buildings Department is only responsible for checking the structural stability of government properties. Since the TRP Game Zone was private property, no negligence of that department has been proved. The Town Planning branch of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) issued a notice under Section 260 (2) of the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Act, 1949, to demolish the structure of the TRP Game Zone in April 2023. However, it was not demolished. In this case, the arrested former TP officer Mansukh Sagathiya claimed that he instructed subordinates to demolish the unauthorised structure, but they didn't. SIT sources suggest that if subordinates did not comply with notices, it was Sagathiya’s responsibility to demolish the structure.

Gujarat Congress leader Paresh Dhanani had announced his decision to contest the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections from Rajkot, and this equation made the constituency an important seat. His announcement came in response to the continued candidacy of union minister, Parshottam Rupala, amid growing discontent over his controversial remarks about Kshatriyas. Dhanani, who previously served as the Leader of Opposition in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly, likened Rupala’s comments to the disrobing of Draupadi in the Mahabharata, highlighting the perceived insult to the Kshatriya community. Rajkot registered an average voting figure of 59.60% on May 7 polling in the phase III. Despite initial hesitations, senior Congress leaders persuaded Dhanani to enter the fray, setting the stage for a high-stakes electoral battle. On the other side, the BJP’s Rupala, a member of the Patidar community and current union agriculture minister, faced severe backlash from the Kshatriya community. This dissent stemmed from his remarks concerning historical inter-faith marriages between Maharajas and Mughals. Despite apologising and engaging with community leaders, the agitation against him continued growing. The conflict peaked on Apr 15, when over 1,50,000 Kshatriya community members from Gujarat and neighbouring states rallied in Rajkot. The ‘Kshatriya Maha Semmelan’ remained peaceful but resolute, in its demand for the BJP to withdraw Rupala’s candidacy. The Congress hoped to capitalise on this unrest, positioning Dhanani as a candidate who could’ve unified and represented the diverse interests of the constituency. All eyes were on this high-profile contest that could shift the political dynamics in this key Gujarat constituency. (With inputs from syndicated feed)",rajkot

The raid was conducted on a tip-off received by the FDCA, Gandhinagar, which suggested suspicious cheese manufacturing in Rajkot. Since the dairy holds a licence from the FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) as a wholesaler for dairy products and a licence for the dairy unit, it was found that the paneer and cream manufacturing was being carried out without permission. In the investigation, there was a strong suspicion of adulteration of vegetable oil in cheese, cream, milk, and the production was found to be conducted in unhygienic conditions. A total of four samples of milk, cheese, cream, and vegetable oil were taken from the premises in presence of the firm owners, and the remaining quantity of products was seized. Paneer (1,310 kg) and milk (2,000 litres), whose value is estimated to be more than ₹3.80 lakh, were voluntarily destroyed by the trader.

The Congress leaders also threatened to protest till their questions were not discussed in the meeting. The mayor instructed the marshals to forcibly remove the Congress corporators from the meeting. In response, the Opposition members chanted slogans against the BJP and protested with banners about the fire. Notably, some of the fire victims were also present as spectators at the board meeting. The audience gallery was packed with the affected families of the Rajkot fire tragedy. Moreover, Congress leader Rohitsinh Rajput was also detained at home.

Rajkot police arrests Haryana man who learnt ATM theft via YouTube,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/rajkot-police-arrests-haryana-man-who-learnt-atm-theft-via-youtube,2024-08-21,21,08,2024,"Rajkot’s Bhaktinagar police have arrested one Anish Safi Mohammad Mav (31), a resident of Nuh, Haryana, for orchestrating various ATM frauds influenced by YouTube videos. Anish, a mechanical engineer-turned-thief, started manipulating ATMs by using a key to access the monitor, withdraw money, and then cause a transaction error by turning off the switch inside the monitor. Afterwards, he would call the bank’s helpline, falsely claiming that the money was deducted from his account but not dispensed by the ATM. This led the bank to reverse the transaction, allowing him to commit fraud by receiving the money twice. It has been revealed that he has carried out similar frauds with several banks in Haryana, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. Anish entered the Canara Bank ATM located in Shyam Complex near Nagarik Bank Chowk in Rajkot, withdrew ₹9,000, tampered with the ATM, caused the transaction to decline, and filed a complaint to retrieve the ₹9,000. However, his scheme was exposed, and the bank filed a complaint against him with the Bhaktinagar police. Based on this, Police Inspector (PI) Mayurdhwajsinh Sarvaiya and Police Sub-Inspector (PSI) M N Vasava started an investigation and arrested him. The police seized two ATM cards used in the crime, a total of 33 ATM cards from different banks, and two keys used to open the ATM monitor. They also confiscated his mobile phone and a total of ₹5,000 in cash. During questioning, the police learned that Anish previously worked at an automobile company in Sanand. After the company faced shutdown, he returned to Haryana, where he prepared for the Junior Clerk exam in the electrical department for about a year but failed. After his recurring failure, he met a friend who informed him about ATM fraud. He then learned how to commit fraud by watching videos on YouTube. He then started committing ATM fraud, beginning with Haryana and later expanding to Rajasthan and Gujarat. In Gujarat, he committed fraud twice in Nadiad, four to five times in Ahmedabad, six times in Jamnagar, seven to eight times in Rajkot, twice in Gandhidham of Kutch, and in other cities including Surendranagar. Over the past two years, he has committed numerous frauds with several banks, but this is the first time he has been caught. He rented different bank accounts, obtained their ATM cards, and used them to commit fraud. Since the amount was less than ₹10,000, in 60% of cases, the bank refunded the amount. He informed the police that in the cases he claimed,he successfully received the amount in 60% of cases. When the banks checked the CCTV cameras installed in the ATM and saw footage of him withdrawing the money, they did not refund the amount to his account, i.e., the amount was not reversed to his account.

Rajkot man confesses to murdering mentally ill mother on social media,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/rajkot-man-confesses-to-murdering-mentally-ill-mother-on-social-media,2024-08-30,30,08,2024,"Rajkot crime A 22-year-old man has been detained for murdering his mentally ill mother in Rajkot, after he allegedly confessed to the crime on social media. Prima facie, Jyoti Gosai—48-year-old single mother to Nilesh Gosai—appears to have been strangled with a blanket, police said. Officials launched an investigation into the incident after one of Nilesh’s friends called the police and alerted 108 emergency services. When emergency officials arrived at the Gosais’ home near Vir Bhagatsinh Garden in the city’s University Road area, they found Jyoti already dead. A primary investigation by the Gandhigram-2 police revealed that Nilesh killed his mother in a fit of rage amid one of their frequent altercations, allegedly brought on by Jyoti’s erratic behaviour, and verbal and physical abuse. After the murder, Nilesh posted a photo of himself and his mother on social media, with a disturbing status that read: “I killed my mom, lost my life, sorry mom, Om Shanti, miss you mom.” Complicated family history Nilesh reportedly told the police that his mother was awarded custody of him after his parents divorced when he was about 18 months old. However, he was later sent to live in a boys’ home in Kutch after Jyoti’s unstable mental health led to her being institutionalised. When he aged out of the system, he returned to live with his mother, who stopped taking her medication over the past month. Nilesh, a factory worker, told the police that his mother’s behaviour had become increasingly erratic and disruptive. He claimed she would physically assault him throughout the day and night, making it impossible for him to rest adequately. Nilesh also reported that his mother would often become violent, sometimes tearing her own clothes. He told police that he lost control and strangled her, during a particularly intense episode in the early hours of Aug 29. This incident underscores the critical importance of accessible and consistent mental health care as well as the need for support services for caregivers and family members of those with mental health challenges. Prioritising mental health awareness, reducing stigma, and ensuring continuous care are crucial steps in preventing such tragic situations.

The tragic event unfolded when the vehicle with the husband, wife, and their young son, was swept away while crossing a bridge over the swollen river. The body of the child was found today, 48 hours after the incident. Sources said, “The Radiya family, hailing from Babra taluka, was en route to visit relatives in Big Khilori village when the vehicle became trapped in the powerful current, leaving the family stranded and helpless. “Despite immediate efforts to locate them, the husband and wife, identified as Jayaraj Radiya (40) and Sonal Radiya (39), were found dead approximately 10 hours after the incident. Their bodies were recovered about 200 feet downstream from the bridge.” “Their seven-year-old son, Dharma Radiya, remained missing for two agonising days. His body was eventually discovered 48 hours later, having been carried downstream to Meta Khambhaliya village, several kms from the initial site of the mishap. The child’s remains were subsequently taken to Gondal Civil Hospital for post-mortem examination,” the sources added. The family had embarked on their journey early on August 28, intending to reach the home of their relative Raju Padmani in Big Khilori village. They were on their way to attend the final rites of a relative in Karia village in Junagadh district. However, the heavy rains that lashed the region for days resulted in flooding of rivers and streams. “On the afternoon of August 29, the couple’s three daughters performed the final rites of their parents,” sources added. As of today, Gujarat has received 111% of its average seasonal rainfall. Kutch zone recorded the highest rainfall at over 177%, followed by the Saurashtra zone with more than 124%, and the South Gujarat zone with over 111%. East-Central Gujarat received more than 105%, while North Gujarat still lags with 87% of the season’s average rainfall.

Chinese garlic in Gondal market yard triggers protests in Saurashtra,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/chinese-garlic-in-gondal-market-yard-triggers-protests-in-saurashtra,2024-09-10,10,09,2024,"Chinese garlic Despite a decade-long ban on importing Chinese garlic into India, a massive influx of Chinese garlic—four to five times the usual amount—has triggered outrage among traders and farmers in Saurashtra. The Rajkot Yard Traders Association suspects that the garlic found in Gondal may have arrived in large containers directly from China. They have demanded a thorough government investigation into the matter and called for an immediate halt to such imports. In protest, traders in Rajkot and other markets across Saurashtra have announced a halt to garlic auctions for the day. There are also reports of Chinese garlic being found in a warehouse in Upleta, raising concerns that large quantities of garlic from China may have entered India illegally via another country, bypassing the ban. According to the Rajkot Market Yard Commission Agent Association, “Chinese garlic is larger, but its taste and quality are inferior. This is why Indian garlic remains in high demand worldwide. There is a suspicion that this Chinese garlic may have been dumped in India via Afghanistan. To raise awareness and prompt government action, traders across Saurashtra will stop garlic auctions today and protest in markets where Indian garlic is grown.” Last year in September, garlic prices in the yard ranged between ₹1,400 and ₹2,200 per mann (a local unit of measurement, roughly equalling 40 kg). By August 9 this year, prices had risen from ₹2,500 to ₹3,400 per mann, and the market saw a further increase from August 10 onward. On August 22, prices peaked at ₹5,500, though today the rates have stabilised between ₹3,500 and ₹5,100—still nearly 2.5 times higher than the previous year. Gujarat produces over 2 lakh tonnes of garlic annually, and farmers in Saurashtra have been receiving good prices for their crops this year. However, with the large-scale dumping of Chinese garlic feared, there is concern that the market could collapse. Amidst these fears, serious questions have been raised regarding how 750 kgs of Chinese garlic entered the Gondal Yard, especially since the yard’s chairman is a leader from the ruling BJP.

Ex-Gujarat minister urges PM Modi to ‘save Saurashtra’ with Kalpasar Project,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/ex-gujarat-minister-urges-pm-narendra-modi-to-save-saurashtra-with-kalpasar-project,2024-09-11,11,09,2024,"PM Narendra Modi, Bavaku Undhad Former BJP minister Bavaku Undhad has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking the inclusion of Amreli district in the Kalpasar Project. He emphasised that while some districts and talukas of the Saurashtra region have benefited from Narmada-based irrigation schemes, areas such as Amreli, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Porbandar, Devbhumi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Surendranagar, and Botad have been left out. In the letter to the PM, Undhad states that farmers in these regions rely heavily on irrigation water from borewells and wells, making the Kalpasar Project essential for boosting agricultural activities. He highlighted that the project’s feasibility and pre-feasibility reports, along with 44 other necessary reports, were completed by 2022, yet the implementation has been delayed. This delay, Undhad argued, is hindering the region’s growth. The Kalpasar Project, once implemented, would significantly benefit the agricultural landscape of Amreli, Bhavnagar, Gir Somnath, and Rajkot districts. Undhad pointed out that Amreli, being a primarily agrarian district, has witnessed large-scale migration. The successful execution of the project would reverse this trend and ensure that both Amreli and the broader Saurashtra region thrive agriculturally and economically. He further stated that it would also shorten travel routes between southern and central Gujarat, curbing the ongoing migration from Saurashtra. This migration, he noted, includes educated individuals and professionals moving to cities like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Surat, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, as well as abroad,  to Canada and the US. Farmers, artisans, and labourers have also been migrating in large numbers due to lack of opportunities in the region. “The Kalpasar Project is the only way to save Saurashtra,” Undhad declared, stressing the need for immediate implementation. He also emphasised the broader benefits, such as reducing travel time and costs for the state and preserving environmental resources like diesel, petrol, and gas. Undhad called on the central government to declare the project as a national initiative, with an 80:20 funding ratio, where 80% of the project cost would be covered by the central government and 20% by the state government. Finally, the former minister cited a survey predicting a potential 15% decline in agricultural productivity due to pollution. He stressed that the project is crucial for safeguarding the region’s future generations and should be prioritised over other development initiatives, especially given India’s reliance on imports for certain food products like pulses and oil.",rajkot

In a recent hearing, Chief Justice Sunita Agrawal and Justice Pranav Trivedi criticised the 1,800-page affidavit submitted by the municipal commissioner, deeming it a useless attempt to justify failures rather than admit mistakes. The court dismissed the affidavit, stating that the municipal commissioner should have acknowledged his fault and apologised for the incident. The court emphasised that the civic chief cannot evade responsibility by shifting blame to subordinate officials. The accountability does lie with the municipal commissioner. The report from the fact-finding committee, which had relieved the municipal commissioner of responsibility, was not accepted by the court. The High Court issued a notice to the municipal commissioner, demanding an explanation for the steps taken following the court’s previous orders and measures to compensate the families affected by the fire.

The notice was issued under Section 260(1) of the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporations Act, 1949 (GPMC Act) for demolishing an 18 sqm illegal construction in the bungalow, which was built in violation of building plans. The bungalow, which is officially registered under the name of Bhavana Sadiya on municipal records, is located in Anamika Society-6 on University Road. City Engineer Kuntesh Mehta of the West Zone stated that if the illegal construction is not demolished voluntarily, it will be taken down under police supervision. As the construction is new, it cannot be regularised under the Impact Fee Act. Notably, when Sagathiya was arrested, there were complaints from residents about his illegal construction at this site, but the municipal corporation had not taken action at that time. City Engineer Mehta was previously an Assistant to Sagathiya when he was assistant TPO. Sagathiya, who was appointed as TPO by the ruling BJP, served in this important position for ten years.

The then municipal commissioner of Rajkot, Udit Agarwal, had awarded a contract to Ranjit Buildcon for the construction of four bridges from the state’s Bridge Grant. Four over-bridges were to be constructed in the Kalawad Road area, with an estimated cost of ₹172.65 crore. However, the work was expedited under questionable circumstances, with an additional ₹79 crore approved, resulting in a total expenditure of ₹251 crore. At that time, the elected term of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation had ended, and a bureaucratic administration had been appointed. During such administrative periods, only urgent routine works should be undertaken, and the bridge construction in Rajkot was not an emergency. The agency had requested an additional ₹79 crore and negotiations and re-tendering should have been conducted to save the public’s money. However, suspicion of corruption arose when the commissioner, in haste, awarded the contract to a single agency, Ranjit Buildcon, before the elections were announced. This resulted in delays in the bridge works, causing severe traffic issues for the public. Ranjit Buildcon was previously awarded two contracts by the corporation. (1) ESR (Elevated Service Reservoir) and GSR (Ground Service Reservoir) Water Works at Rajyadharam for ₹29.73 crore on March 8, 2019. (2) ESR work at GETCO Chowkdi for ₹45.50 crore on February 29, 2020. These projects were to be completed by December 21, 2021. However, Ranjit Buildcon took approximately two years longer to complete these projects, finishing them on July 27, 2023, and March 7, 2024, respectively. As a result, despite the higher cost, people had to endure inadequate filtration and an overloaded filter plant for water distribution. Notably, after these contracts were awarded, Vijay Rupani resigned in September 2021, and the commissioner was subsequently transferred. However, no thorough investigation has been conducted into these multi-crore projects, no action has been taken against anyone, and no significant penalties have been imposed.

Gaurango had informed Nandha that he had contacts with traders in Gujarat and outside the state and asked him to invest in gold to help expand their business. Trusting Gaurango, Ashish purchased a property and started a hallmark centre. In 2023, he also acquired the necessary machinery for the workshop to assist the workers. Later, Gaurango and Saurabh were given 2.5 kilograms of gold to create jewellery, and they began working on it. They also introduced Nandha to another businessman, who promised to provide them with work. In July, Nandha trusted the duo with 4,436 kilograms of gold to start making jewellery. They produced jewellery worth 620 grams of gold, which Nandha delivered to a jeweller from Indore, and received payment in his account. However, the remaining 3,816 kilograms of gold, amounting to ₹2.56 crore, remained with Gaurango. He left on October 3, informing that his wife had health issues, and has not returned. His brother also went missing after that day. Nandha has filed a complaint with the police regarding the incident.

In the video, Dhruvil asks his mother for forgiveness and urges his parents to remain happy so his soul can find solace. “Don’t cry after I’m gone,” he says. In his suicide note, he mentions a few of his acquaintances, including his teachers: Solanki sir, Mausam madam, Vibhuti madam, and Sachin sir, and his friends: Sahil and Ram. A police probe has been launched following the incident. The suicide note and the video have been collected by Lodhika’s Metoda police. An initial probe suggests that academic and exam stress, coupled with instances of rude behaviour by his teachers, including falsely threatening to hand him over to the police, may have contributed to this tragic incident. Motvada and Chhapra villages, where the child travelled to and from school, have also been under the scanner. Police are also investigating the teacher who Dhruvil mentioned as being wronged in the video.

BJP accused of bribing Congress candidates to pull out from local body elections,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/bjp-accused-of-bribing-congress-candidates-to-pull-out-from-local-body-elections,2025-02-06,6,02,2025,"BJP in Upleta, Rajkot, have been reportedly accused of bribing Congress candidates to pull out from the local government body elections in Gujarat. The Opposition has alleged that their candidates were offered ₹10 lakh each to back away from the contest. The Grand Old Party also accused the ruling party's municipalities of sending encroachment notices to Congress candidates to intimidate the candidates. After the scrutiny of nomination forms for the municipality, taluka, and district panchayat elections, the BJP has already secured some seats ‘unopposed’. The Congress has cried foul, raising concerns over the fairness and transparency of the elections, alleging that the BJP has used police and administrative influence to intimidate and force Congress candidates to withdraw their nominations. In Junagadh, 9 out of 60 Congress candidates withdrew their nominations in support of the BJP. So, before the elections, BJP candidates in two wards secured 8 seats unopposed. In Ward No 12, a Congress candidate withdrew, but since other candidates are contesting, the seat will not be unopposed. Out of the 28 seats in Bhachau Municipality’s 7 wards, 11 seats were already secured by the BJP before the election process began. Whether due to administrative influence or Congress’s internal issues, only 17 Congress candidates remain in the fray. However, internal sources from BJP claim that a majority of these remaining Congress candidates are in touch with them. There are even claims that by the final withdrawal deadline on Tuesday, most of the 17 remaining Congress candidates—except for one or two—might also withdraw. All 28 BJP candidates’ nominations have been validated, and the official picture of BJP’s pre-election strategy in Bhachau will become clear soon. In Dharampur Municipality (Valsad district), despite Congress ruling for three decades, the party faces strong public resentment due to a lack of development. Instead of seeking votes on the basis of progress, BJP has allegedly used tactics of persuasion, coercion, and pressure to eliminate Congress and opposition candidates. In Ward No 1, four Congress candidates, and in Ward No 3, one Congress candidate, have gone missing. Instead of campaigning, Congress leaders are spending day and night searching for these five missing candidates while accusing BJP of playing dirty politics, which has heated up the political atmosphere in Dharampur. In Kodinar Municipality, a former BJP MP allegedly formed an illegal committee, disrupting the election environment. Moreover, in Mansa Municipality (Gandhinagar), a BJP MLA exerted continuous political pressure on Congress candidates to force them to withdraw their nominations. In Halvad Municipality, Congress candidates have reportedly been receiving threats since Sunday night. As a result, they had no choice but to request police protection. However, after receiving no appropriate response from the police, they submitted a formal complaint to the sub-divisional magistrate. In Bilimora Municipality, the election officer has been accused of making unconstitutional remarks in favour of the BJP. Meanwhile, in Jodhpur Taluka Panchayat (Mahisagar district), despite Congress filing a detailed objection regarding a BJP candidate’s caste certificate, the election officer made a one-sided decision to approve the BJP candidate’s nomination. Consequently, Congress plans to escalate the matter to the state election commission.",rajkot

The mayor travelled to Prayagraj from February 6 to 12 in her official vehicle, registration number GJ-3 GA 2020. She was accompanied by her husband Vinod Pedhadiya, BJP Mahila Morcha president Kiran Makadia, another corporator from her ward, Kankuben Ughrejiya, and four other women – a total of seven people. Pictures of clothes hanging to dry on the rear door of the SUV outside the Gujarat Pavilion in Prayagraj went viral on social media, sparking widespread discussions about the improper use of an official vehicle. Payment of ₹2 per kilometre Responding to the controversy, Rajkot Standing Committee Chairman Jaymin Thaker said, “Office bearers, including the mayor, can take an official vehicle for personal travel with prior approval from the municipal commissioner. They must pay ₹2 per kilometre for travel outside Gujarat.” “Nayanaben obtained approval from the commissioner, so there is nothing illegal about this. However, I acknowledge that drying clothes on an official car is inappropriate and should not happen,” Thaker added. “Furthermore, any office bearer using an official vehicle should pay a rental amount equivalent to market rates. A resolution will be passed to address this in the future,” said Thaker. Notably, the distance between Rajkot and Prayagraj is approximately 1,500 kilometres. Excluding the distance within Gujarat, the mayor travelled around 1,900 kilometres round-trip. At the rate of ₹2 per kilometre, she would pay only about ₹4,000, whereas a common citizen unable to secure a train or bus ticket would have to spend around ₹35,000–₹36,000 for an SUV rental. City BJP president Mukesh Doshi stated that a report on this matter would be sent to the state-level leadership after the municipal coordination meeting. He also mentioned that the last approved rate was ₹12 per kilometre, and if the current rate is true ₹2 per kilometre, it will be revised.",rajkot

Both leaders were reportedly issued these warrants in the defamation case filed by Nitin Bhardwaj and former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani. Shailesh Parmar, Sukhram Rathwa and C J Chavda had accused Rupani and Bhardwaj of a ₹500 crore scam by changing the zone of the Sahara India Company’s land on Kuvadava road in Rajkot. However, Rupani and Bhardwaj had denied the allegations. Rupani had filed a defamation suit in Gandhinagar and Bhardwaj in a Rajkot court, calling the claims false and absurd. In Gandhinagar, a settlement was reached with former CM Rupani and the other leaders, following which, Rupani had withdrawn his suit. The recent warrants are issued by the Rajkot court. Reacting to the development, Shailesh Parmar reportedly said that the warrants may have been issued as he and Chavda did not attend the last two hearings. He added that further action would be taken by his lawyer. Parmar also noted that just like Gandhinagar, the case in Rajkot is also likely to be withdrawn in the same pattern. Chavda, on the other hand, said that these are not arrest warrants, but just a notice to appear in the court on March 21. He added that a settlement had already been reached, and it was now just a matter of appearing in court. Notably, Chavda resigned as MLA of Vijapur in January 2024 and joined the BJP.",rajkot

Gujarat HC rejects anticipatory bail of Swaminarayan monk accused of sexual assault,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-hc-rejects-anticipatory-bail-of-swaminarayan-monk-accused-of-assault,2025-04-01,1,04,2025,"Gujarat High Court has rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Swaminarayan sect’s fugitive monk, Swami Dharmaswaroopdas Maharaj. The case registered at Bhayavadar police station in Rajkot pertains to the alleged rape of a woman after marrying her in a guesthouse. The high court on Monday dismissed Swami Dharmaswaroopdas’ anticipatory bail application, stating that custodial interrogation of the accused is crucial in such a serious and sensitive case. In his anticipatory bail application, the accused argued that the woman’s parents had placed her in Khirasara Gurukul as she wished to become a sadhvi. He claimed that the woman was an adult and that they got married in the guesthouse, making their relationship consensual, thus ruling out a rape charge. Notably, the Swami fled the country after the case was registered. The state government strongly opposed the anticipatory bail application, asserting that the accused had lured and deceived the woman, taking her to the guest house under false pretences. At the guest house, he allegedly conducted a ritualistic marriage and claimed to be her husband before sexually assaulting her. Furthermore, he allegedly threatened the woman to keep quiet and convinced her that he would remain a monk while she would become a sadhvi. It was also revealed that the woman was allegedly forced to undergo an abortion after the woman got pregnant following the alleged assault. One of the key points highlighted in the case was that only Vadtal Dham had the authority to grant Diksha, yet the accused Swami had performed the initiation ceremony at the Gurukul. Since the incident, the accused has been on the run and is considered a fugitive. A lookout notice has also been issued against him. The prosecution presented WhatsApp chats between the woman and the accused, along with evidence backed by Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) before the Gujarat HC. The public prosecutor argued that the accused Swami faces serious charges of rape, and granting him anticipatory bail would send a negative message to society and the Swaminarayan sect. It was also contended that he could influence witnesses and tamper with evidence if released on bail. Considering the gravity of the crime, the high court upheld the state’s arguments and outrightly rejected Swami’s anticipatory bail application.

"Four, including Padminiba Vala who extorted ₹7 lakh from 80-yr-old, arrested in Gondal",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/four-including-padminiba-vala-who-extorted-rs-7-lakh-from-80-yr-old-arrested-in-gondal,2025-04-20,20,04,2025,"A police complaint was filed in Gondal against five individuals—including social activist Padminiba Vala—for honey-trapping an elderly man and extorting ₹7 lakh to ₹8 lakh from him through intimidation. In a significant late-night operation, police arrested four of the accused, including Vala. One accused is absconding. An 80-year-old man residing on Jetpur Road filed a complaint at Gondal police station against a woman named Tejal Chhaya, Padminiba Vala, her son Satyajitsinh Vala, and two others named Shyam Raychura, and Hiren Devadiya. As per the complaint, about 15 days ago while sitting outside his house in Gondal, the elderly man was approached by a woman in a rickshaw who identified herself as Chhaya. She initially asked for an address and then returned shortly after, striking up a conversation to build trust and eventually took his mobile number. The next day, the woman called him claiming her husband had died and she was extremely distressed, pleading for help to repay her debts and threatening to take her own life. Over the next couple of days, the two continued communicating, including engaging in inappropriate behaviour over video calls. Then, on Wednesday night, Vala allegedly called the elderly man, threatening him and demanding to talk about Chhaya. When the man stopped answering their calls, Chhaya, along with Vala, her son, and the two other men, reportedly barged into his house and harassed him for three hours. They then took him to an office in Mavdi, forced a settlement of ₹7 to ₹8 lakh, and left after issuing threats. Frightened by the incident, the elderly man filed a police complaint in Gondal on Friday, prompting swift action by the authorities. On Saturday night, the police arrested Vala, her son Satyajitsinh, Raychura, and Devadiya. The prime accused, Chhaya, is still on the run.",rajkot
