The Sardar Samman Sankalp Andolan Samiti, Karamsad, organised a rally at 10 am on Sunday to raise objection to the inclusion, demanding the government to announce the village as an independent entity, to preserve its identity as the birth place of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The villagers believe that the identity and existence of Sardar’s Karamsad will cease to exist if it will be merged with the Anand Municipal Corporation. They also decided to launch a signature campaign and expand the protest statewide. Against the ‘injustice’ of the inclusion of Sardar Patel’s hometown in the Anand Municipal Corporation, all the traders were requested to down their shutters and make the bandh a success.

Villagers up in arms against sale of Anand land worth ₹114 cr to Rajkot Swaminarayan Gurukul for ₹38 cr,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/controversy-erupts-as-rs-114-cr-anand-land-sold-to-rajkot-swaminarayan-gurukul-for-rs-38-cr,2025-02-26,26,02,2025,"Villagers of Kahanvadi village in Anklav, Anand are up against the Gujarat government for allegedly allocating 237 bighas of land, valued at approximately ₹113.76 crore, to Rajkot Swaminarayan Gurukul at a significantly lower price of just ₹37.48 crore for educational purposes. Opposing the decision, the villagers have halted the payment of revenue and warned of protests if the allocation is not revoked. Dispute over land allocation The manager of Rajkot Swaminarayan Gurukul visited the Kahanvadi Gram Panchayat to pay the allocated land’s revenue. Villagers gathered and inquired about the matter following the manager's visit. The manager presented a circular issued by the Anand district collector and the land survey department, stating that approximately 37x38x75 hectares (237 bighas) of government wasteland in Kahanvadi had been allocated for educational use. The government had assessed the land’s value at ₹37.48 crore, as mentioned in the circular. However,  according to the villagers, the value of the land is much higher. So, the villagers refused to accept the revenue payment. After heated arguments, the cheque for the payment was not accepted. During their inquiries, villagers found that the land was allocated to Rajkot Swaminarayan Gurukul without their consent, through a government circular. Villagers estimate that the actual market value of the land is around ₹350 crore, far higher than the price at which it was given away. Demand to revoke land allocation Villagers have temporarily halted the revenue payment and expressed strong opposition, stating that their prior consent was not taken. They argue that this land could be used for public housing. Additionally, since a railway line passes through the village, many small farmers have already lost their land, and no land has been allocated to locals for residential purposes. Villagers plan to submit a petition to the District Collector on Thursday demanding the revocation of the land allocation. They have also warned of protests if their demands are not met. According to local farmers, the government has sold 237 bighas of land at an estimated rate of ₹16 lakh per bigha. However, due to the industrial zone developing nearby, the market price of land in the same area is ₹40lakh-50 lakh per bigha. Based on this market value, the total worth of the 237 bighas would be around ₹113.76 crore. Villagers are outraged that the government has allocated such a valuable piece of land at an extremely low price, calling it an unfair and unjust decision.",anand

Villagers to intensify agitation On Monday afternoon, more than 800 villagers are likely to visit the district collector’s office to submit a petition regarding the decision to take back the land. Former chief minister of Gujarat Shankersinh Vaghela said that it is a rule that the government cannot give land to anyone if a gram panchayat or villagers refuse to give their land to the government. “The government has approved the deal secretly through an administrator, which is very shameful.

In a viral video on social media, Solanki accused Pappu Pathak of falsely claiming farmland ownership in 2003 through a will, enabling him to gain farmer status. However, a land revenue case was initiated against him in 2007, and on September 20, 2009, it was proved that he was not a farmer.

Solanki alleged that Pathak now owns over 160 bighas of land across 10 villages, including Vadadala, Karanpura, Balasinor, Handia, Dev, Khedgodhra, Bhatda, Gagheda, Shakariya, and Natwarpura. Solanki also claimed that while Pathak served as an MLA from 2002 to 2007, he has been an Amul director from the Balasinor block for 10  years, from 2015 to 2025. According to him, Amul’s current chairman Vipul Patel is just a figurehead, while the real administration is controlled by Pappu Pathak, leading to growing tensions in cooperative politics. “Pappu Pathak and his family have exploited dairy farmers and accumulated over 160 bighas of land. I will personally file a complaint with the government regarding this in the coming days,” said Solanki. “I have no response to give. He belongs to Congress and can make any accusations he wants. I don’t need to respond to his claims; he keeps talking anyway,” responded Pathak. Also read: Land grabbing case: Absconding accused Dhaval Barot nabbed",anand
"‘Quality education key to India’s growth’, says EAM Jaishankar at Anand university",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/quality-education-key-to-indias-growth-says-eam-jaishankar-at-anand-university,2025-04-16,16,04,2025,"An interactive session was held at a university in Anand, Gujarat, where India’s External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar, addressed students on Tuesday. He emphasised that one of the key indicators of a nation’s development and progress is the presence of good universities. According to him, without quality educational institutions, a country cannot truly be considered developed. Speaking on international issues at the Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT), Jaishankar remarked that while Pakistan is known globally for ‘International Terrorism (IT)’, India is recognised for ‘Information Technology (IT).’ This sharp comparison highlighted the differing global perceptions of the two neighboring countries. He noted that universities reflect a nation’s real economy and society, and the existence of strong educational institutions signals a progressive nation. During his speech, he also recalled the leadership and patriotism of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, especially his strategic thinking on China and efforts to unify the nation. Touching on the role of Indian youth globally, Jaishankar said that the connection between India and the world has grown significantly. Due to their talent and skills, Indian youth are being welcomed on global work platforms, including in countries like Germany and the United States, which have wealth, power, and advanced technology. On the issue of Pakistan, he stated that India has changed, but while Pakistan claims to have changed too, their negative habits remain. He criticized Pakistan for playing a double game with countries like the US and in matters involving Afghanistan and the Taliban. He said the world is now realising these deceptive tactics, which are leading to adverse consequences for Pakistan. Referring to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, he called it a major turning point for India, sparking public outrage and firm resolve against such acts from neighboring countries. Regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Jaishankar explained that during the war, there was pressure from Western countries for India to boycott Russia. However, India noticed that those same countries continued to import goods from Russia for their own benefit, while pressuring India to stop buying petrol. India chose to act in its national interest and continued oil imports, which helped keep fuel prices under control and benefited the people.",anand
