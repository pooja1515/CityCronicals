BJP battles Kshatriya community’s angst across Gujarat amid Rupala row,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/bjp-battles-kshatriya-communitys-angst-across-gujarat-amid-rupala-row,2024-04-24,24,04,2024,"Rupala controversy Growing angst among the Kshatriya community in Gujarat against union minister Parshottam Rupala is escalating the difficulties of the state’s BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) faction. The BJP’s party workers and candidates are facing obstacles in campaigning, resulting in frequent changes in routes and schedules. In Anand’s Umreth taluka, the BJP faced severe opposition while campaigning, where a large number of Kshatriyas gathered and protested against Rupala and the saffron party. A group of Kshatriya community members also expressed their outrage near Umereth’s Choravaga temple, where BJP workers had to resort to fleeing the spot. Placards and fliers opposing Rupala were also put up in Umreth about fifteen days ago. Women of the Rajput community in Umreth had also vowed to vote against the BJP. Rupala stoked a controversy on Mar 22 after he said at a public event that the erstwhile ‘maharajas’ broke bread with the British and also married off their daughters to them. The statement invited the wrath of various Kshatriya organisations. However, Rupala has submitted a public apology over his statements. But it failed to dampen the outrage against him. Kshatriyas outraged in Sabarkantha North Gujarat’s Sabarkantha Lok Sabha constituency also saw the saffron party facing flak from the Kshatriyas. Shobhna Baraiya, the BJP’s candidate from Sabarkantha, was opposed heavily by the Kshatriya community while campaigning in Himmatnagar’s Hapa and Dedhrota villages on Apr 23.

There are also 24 candidates aspiring to 5 seats up for bye-election. With 12 lakh voters gearing up to exercise their franchise for the first time this year, Bharathi said the EC is permitting a print-out of the EPIC card as a valid document allowing one to vote. Meanwhile, 22,700 voters have signed up for the government’s ‘vote-from-home’ option, available to senior citizens ages 85+, and persons with disabilities. Bharathi was addressing the press as part of the Election Commission’s bid to raise voter awareness given the low turnout in the early phases of the election completed so far. Gujarat will go to the polls in Phase 3 on May 7. Gujarat has a total of 26 parliamentary seats to be filled, but BJP candidate Mukesh Dalal for Surat is running unopposed after all other contenders withdrew their candidacy.

Navsari has the highest numbers of men voters and Bharuch has the lowest number of men voters, and Dahod has the highest number of youth voters between the ages of 18 to 29 years, she also said. Block development offices have started to distribute voter information slips to every household, to further encourage voting, Bharathi further stated. To maintain fairness and transparency in the upcoming elections, the state’s chief electoral officer has initiated suo motu action in 19 instances. The Election Commission has also sought a report from the returning officer for Surat on the withdrawal of candidates. ‘Action against 42k bootleggers’ Shamsher Singh, the Additional Director-General in charge of law and order in the Gujarat police, was also present at the briefing. He said that, in the recent past, the cops have taken action against 42,000 bootleggers and arrested 30 smugglers. He added that 1,400 cases have been registered under the Gujarat Prevention of Anti-Social Activities (PASA) Act, with 97% bailable warrants being issued in this process. Gujarat police have tied up with neighbouring states and have seized ₹42 crore in cash and valuables at 133 checkposts along the state border ahead of the elections, Singh added.

Cyber tech helps Gandhinagar police recover 230 mobile phones in 1 month,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/cyber-tech-helps-gandhinagar-police-recover-230-mobile-phones-in-1-month,2024-04-25,25,04,2024,"In a strategic effort to combat crime using cyber technology, Gandhinagar police have recovered 230 stolen mobile phones in one month through the Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), District police superintendent Vasamsetty Ravi Teja told the press on Apr 25. He explained that specially trained teams from the Gandhinagar district police recovered the devices based on complaints of mobile theft registered in Gandhinagar district and city. The teams travelled to various locations in Gujarat, as well as from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh for this recovery process. “We have sent the recovered phones, cumulatively worth about ₹30 lakh, to local police stations, from where they will be returned to their owners,” a senior official of the Gandhinagar local crime branch said. The cases are still under investigation since, in most cases, the devices recovered from innocent people who bought them second-hand are not involved in the thefts. A joint initiative between the police and the Department of Telecom, CEIR allows users and the police to input a stolen or lost phone’s IMEI number and request that it be blocked to prevent the device from being used for illegal activities. When you block a smartphone on CEIR's website, it will be blocked on the central database and cannot be used and an alternate number has been given for the phone. Given its nationwide presence, CEIR can track if and when any unauthorised person attempts to activate the blocked phone anywhere in the country. If such an attempt is detected, the phone will send a SMS to a given alternate number, allowing the phone to be traced and recovered by the police,” the crime branch official added. In order to request that a stolen/lost phone be blocked, users need to upload a digital copy of the complaint filed with the local police, as well as the number of the SIM card, the phone’s IMEI number and a copy of the mobile purchase invoice.",gandhinagar
"BJP, Congress, and Kshatriya community in showdown at Gujarat’s Surendranagar",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/bjp-congress-and-kshatriya-community-in-showdown-at-gujarats-surendranagar,2024-04-25,25,04,2024,"Surendranagar Lok Sabha In the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and the Congress are expected to be in a face-off. The BJP has nominated Chandu Shihora, a community leader. Shihora, a civil engineer and former president of the Morbi district panchayat and ex-vice president of the Morbi district BJP, hails from Halvad taluka of Morbi. He is a prominent figure within the Chuvaliya Koli community, known for his involvement in community-oriented events like mass weddings and student felicitation functions. This nomination marks a shift as the party has chosen not to field the current Lok Sabha MP, Dr Mahendra Munjapara, who also belongs to the same community. Congress’ bid for Morbi Lok Sabha seat On the opposition front, the Congress has positioned Rutvik Makwana, a current member of the legislative assembly from Chotila constituency, to strengthen its campaign. Makwana, also from the Koli caste, has been a vocal critic of the BJP, evidenced by his arrest in March 2021 during a tractor rally against prime minister Narendra Modi. His political activism includes his role as the chief organiser of the ‘Gujarat Pradesh Seva Dal’, appointed by Rahul Gandhi in 2018. Kshatriya unrest in Surendranagar Amidst this political contest, a strong campaign titled ‘Kshatriya Asmita Dharmarath’ was launched on Apr 23. This three-day campaign to mobilise against the BJP traversed over 30 villages in Surendranagar district. Spearheaded by community leaders and supported by a newly formed committee of young Kshatriyas, this initiative aims to influence booth-level voting patterns across the district. The rising activism within the Kshatriya community against the BJP has heightened tensions and stakes in the region, setting the stage for a fiercely contested election. Dynamics of Surendranagar Surendranagar is a significant economic hub in Gujarat, with thriving chemical, textile, cotton, and plastic industries. This city holds considerable political importance due to the influence of the Koli community. Historically, Somabhai Patel has been a prominent figure, winning elections from both the Congress and BJP parties. The Surendranagar Lok Sabha constituency encompasses several assembly seats: Viramgam, Limbdi, Dhrangadhra, Dhandhuka, Wadhwan, Dhasa, and Chotila, with the Dhasa seat being reserved for the SC category. The first parliamentary election in this region was held in 1962 and was won by a Congress candidate. The constituency has seen various political shifts, including victories by the Swatantra Party. Soma Patel won the seat in 1989 as a BJP candidate, defeating the Congress candidate, and repeated his success in 1991. However, in 1996, he lost to Sanat Mehta of the Congress. After a hiatus during the 1998 and 1999 elections, he returned to contest in 2004 on a BJP ticket. In recent elections, Mahendra Munjapara from the BJP won in 2019 with a significant margin, while in 2014, Devji Bhai of the BJP secured the seat with 56% of the votes, with Soma Patel from the Congress trailing with 34.5%.

Meanwhile, Junagadh BJP chief Kirit Patel has been given a clean chit over his statements on royal families as well as disabled people. The Election Commission’s enforcement officer in Visavadar submitted a report on Apr 24 to the assistant returning officer (ARO) regarding the speeches. These statements were passed by Bhayani during the inauguration of the BJP’s office in Visavadar. Both of these statements, by Bhayani and Patel, were scrutinised for violations of the moral code of conduct. Sources close to the developments suggested that Bhayani’s statement on Gandhi, deemed personal, was flagged as a violation of the code of conduct. However, as the district BJP chief’s comments were not personal, the MCC standards remained intact, over which a report was submitted to the nodal officer. Meanwhile, the complainant in this row, an electoral candidate himself, Alpesh Trambadia, has appealed to the district election officer (DEO), demanding action against this violation.

The political battle of Junagadh and its Lok Sabha election dynamics,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/the-political-battle-of-junagadh-and-its-lok-sabha-election-dynamics,2024-04-27,27,04,2024,"Junagadh Lok Sabha Elections Few constituencies in Indian politics capture the interplay of local and national interests as well as the Junagadh Lok Sabha seat in Gujarat. The seat, a stronghold of the BJP, presents a compelling narrative with its history and the intense rivalry between the BJP and the Congress. BJP’s Rajesh Chudasama in the fray The BJP’s Rajesh Chudasama is the current MP from the Junagadh-Gir Somnath constituency. A political figure with deep roots in local governance, Chudasama was previously an MLA from Mangrol in Junagadh district, elected under the BJP banner in 2012. His rise to prominence was marked by a significant victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and a repeat success in 2019, where he solidified his status with 547,952 votes. Coming from the Koli caste, he holds a significant sway over a crucial voter base in the region. Congress candidate Hira Jotva On the other side, Congress presents Hira Jotva, a multifaceted personality who juggles roles as a politician, farmer, and entrepreneur. Jotva has been an integral part of the Congress from an early age. His diverse career includes leadership roles in educational NGOs and a tenure as the vice president of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC). Jotva’s grassroots connection was further strengthened through his earlier stints as the Sarpanch of Supasi village and the leader of Junagadh and Gir Somnath district panchayat’s opposition. Junagadh Lok Sabha constituency dynamics With a population exceeding 27 lakh as per the 2011 census, the district thrives on its robust fishing industry supported by major ports like Veraval and Porbandar. Politically, the constituency has been a battleground with fluctuating allegiances, though the BJP has maintained a strong foothold in recent elections. Junagadh’s political landscape has been vibrant and contested, with its inception as a general seat in 1962, first won by the Congress. The BJP’s prominence was highlighted when Bhavna Chikhalia became the first woman from the district to win this seat in 1991, achieving four-consecutive victories thereafter. The seat’s significance in Gujarat’s political sphere is profound, reflecting the area’s democratic spirit and critical role in shaping the state’s and possibly the nation’s governance. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Chudasama emerged victorious, securing the seat with a significant margin of 150,211 votes. He received 547,744 votes, translating to a 54% vote share. He was pitted against Punja Vansh of the Congress, who garnered 397,533 votes, representing 39.47% of the vote share. This victory mirrored his performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections where Chudasama triumphed. During that election cycle, he received 513,179 votes, which accounted for 54.46% of the total votes. His opponent, the Congress’ Vansh, received 377,347 votes or 40.05% of the vote share, making the winning margin 135,832 votes. Electoral drives in Junagadh In anticipation of the forthcoming elections on May 7, local establishments in Junagadh district are promoting civic engagement by offering discounts to voters. This initiative, led by Junagadh collector Anil Ranavasiya and the Junagadh Hotel Association, aims to encourage higher voter turnout with a 7% discount on food on polling day. The district administration has ensured all logistical arrangements are in place to facilitate a smooth voting process. Junagadh, covering an area of 8,831 sq kms and bordered by the Arabian Sea, has a rich historical and economic background.

Kshatriya leader PT Jadeja came forward opposing Gandhi’s statements saying, “Rahul Gandhi’s statement is condemnable. Kings and royals have given a lot; they have not taken anything away from anyone. But our issue right now is only to oppose (Parshottam) Rupala. Rupala has made a statement about (our) sisters and daughters. Our fight is for women’s pride, which will continue.” Triptiba Raol, president of the Gujarat Rajput Samaj institutions coordinating committee, had reacted to Gandhi’s statement at a Kshatriya convention in Bardoli, stating, “I condemn Rahul Gandhi’s statement. Such statements should not be tolerated; he should apologise. I am hurt by his statement. But we will not let Rupala be with the statement he has made.” The Congress leader’s comments were also responded to by Bhavanagar’s Yuvaraj Jayveerraj Singh Gohil saying, “It was his grandmother who brought the land ceiling law, resulting in the loss of ownership of land for many citizens.” He added, “A lot of our people lost their land because of such biassed legislation; who is responsible for that?” He further added, “I feel pity for Rahul Gandhi. Sadly, the person whose father and grandmother were the nation’s prime minister has ruined the party.” Congress reacts to this issue Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil said, “BJP insulted sisters and daughters first. Then, out of arrogance, they did not repeal the candidature form. Now what has not even happened is being misrepresented.” He added that, “Kshatriya society is innocent but not foolish. The BJP has come out to do politics on Rahul Gandhi's statement. The BJP’s candidate is insulting sisters and daughters all over the country, so there is resentment among the people of every caste.” During a rally in Karnataka on Apr 27, Rahul said, “It was the rule of kings and Maharajas; they could do whatever they wanted; if they wanted someone’s land, they would take it away. It was the Congress party, and our workers, along with the people of the country, achieved independence and brought democracy.” (With inputs from IANS) Also read: BJP accuses Rahul Gandhi of insulting Rajput community, demands apology",gandhinagar

Sharing details with the press on Apr 29, director-general of police (DGP) Vikas Sahay said that officials seized 173 packages of the psychoactive drug, worth an estimated ₹60 crore. Even as the daring high-seas exercise was underway, in the Arabian Sea, ATS teams were positioned in Pune. The advance team arrested one Kailash Sanap based on intelligence that he was the intended recipient of the consignment from a Pakistani drug lord known as “Fida”. A primary investigation revealed that Mangesh Tukkram and Haridas Kulal had acquired a fishing boat from Ali Asgar Harepotra in Mandvi. The three had met Fida’s associates in the deep sea, and transferred the drugs from the Pakistani boat to Harepotra’s fishing vessel. To avoid suspicion, the consignment was meant to have been handed over to one Dutta Sakharam at Dwarka, from where it would make its way further inland. Sanap, Tukkram, Kulal, Harepotra and Sakharam were all arrested. The case is still underway, DGP Sahay said. He also commended the ICG for its role in the operation. In response, AK Harbola, Inspector-General of ICG, shared that the two law enforcement bodies have conducted 11 joint ops and seized 710 kg of drugs in three years.

The new academic year for schools will now begin on June 13 which was earlier scheduled to reopen  June 10. According to the previous schedule, summer vacation was to start on May 6. However, due to  the Lok Sabha elections in Gujarat on May 7 and the teaching staff’s delegated election duties, it was not possible for the department to commence the vacation from May 6. If the vacation had started on May 6, teachers would have needed compensation for three days off. Due to these complexities, the vacation circular issued by the directorate was put on hold.

PM in Gujarat PM Modi will address public meetings at Deesa in north Gujarat at 2.30 p.m. followed by Himmatnagar at 4.15 pm. His public meetings in Deesa will focus on the Lok Sabha constituencies of Banaskantha and Patan. During his stay at Gandhinagar Circuit House, the official residence during the election period, the dignitary will engage in meetings with key leaders of the BJP. His accomodation at Circuit House instead of Raj Bhavan aligns with the model code of conduct (MCC) regulations. On May 2 he will address public gatherings at Anand and Trimandir ground on Surendranagar-Rajkot Road. Following this, he will proceed to Junagadh and Jamnagar for further engagements. According to reports, the campaign was originally set to commence from Rajkot on Apr 22. However, it was rescheduled due to the ongoing protests from the Kshatriya community directed towards the BJP candidate, Parshottam Rupala. His meetings in Saurashtra These gatherings aim to rally support for Lok Sabha constituencies including Anand, Kheda, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Porbandar, Amreli, and Jamnagar. Notably, these public meetings are to be held under tight police surveillance, with central teams assigned security responsibilities. This vigilance is taken in light of the ongoing Kshatriya agitation across the state over union minister Parshottam Rupala’s remarks. Moreover, police personnel from the Kshatriya community are deployed in around 25 parliamentary constituencies in the state, which include Kshatriya villages and areas with a significant population of the community. The rural units of the BJP have borne the brunt of the Kshatriya unrest across the state, as leaders have to cancel meetings and are facing resistance while campaigning in villages. Meanwhile, Kshatriya groups are persistently organising statewide protests. The BJP’s top leadership is engaging in frequent dialogues to convince the community; however, the party has failed to pacify their uproar. Protests and demonstrations are erupting at their full fledge in Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Mehsana, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Bardoli, Sabarkantha, and Vadodara Lok Sabha constituencies. A public rally by union defence minister Rajnath Singh was protested by a group; however, the police managed to prevent any adversity.

The Election Commission has provided voters aged above 85 and PwDs with 40% benchmark disability the option of home voting by secret ballot, with “a full contingent of polling staff and security personnel”, according to a government statement. Unusually, one of these sets of boots on the ground belongs to Gandhinagar’s collector and returning officer Mehul Dave, who has been visiting such voters at home. Gandhinagar collector Mehul Dave “Most of the voters I visit are in high spirits despite facing a tough situation. They know the value of their votes and are deeply respectful of democracy. I make home visits to encourage such voters,” he told Gujarat Samachar Digital . He shared his experience of visiting the home of 95-year-old Maniben Mavjibhai Rever, who voted at her home on May 1. “She is an inspiration for the youth to vote,” he said. On his visit, Dave was accompanied by poll workers who carried a ballot box and set up a private booth so Maniben could cast her vote by secret ballot. Maniben’s son, Khimjibhai (72), said that his mother has always been a keen observer of national interests. “Despite being illiterate, she also advises my children to go out and vote,” he added with a note of pride. Voters above the age of 85 years, and PwDs with 40% benchmark disability can avail the optional home voting facility. There are over 81 lakh 85+ aged voters and 90 lakh+ PwD voters registered across the country, according to a government statement. This includes many adults like Maniben, who will—hopefully—benefit from the ECI’s “leave no voter behind” policy. While Dave’s efforts, as part of the district administration’s ""Our aim is 100% polling"" awareness campaign has not gone unnoticed, it will be interesting to see if it makes a difference come election day.

By controlling a character through their keyboard functions, the user can virtually simulate performing all the mandatory polling formalities. It starts with a character spawned at a location, from where it has to be directed to the polling station. This character then has to be directed towards all the documentation desks, ahead of entering the polling booth with the EVM machine. A simulated vote could then be cast, fulfilling its eventual objective. This virtual simulation could be accessed with three different characters, with the additional facility to name them. CEO Bharathi expressed enthusiasm about the innovative use of technology to enhance voter education and participation. “Through this virtual reality platform, voters can navigate a simulated voting experience, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of the voting process.

Gujarat govt advisory to avoid pesticide residues in vegetables,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-government-advisory-to-avoid-pesticide-residues-in-vegetables,2024-05-04,4,05,2024,"Vegetables washing Gujarat’s agriculture department has advised people not to consume vegetables without washing them thoroughly with clean water, as they may contain harmful pesticide residues that cannot be easily removed. The department has stated that vegetables may contain substances that are harmful to health and therefore should be consumed with caution. Farmers in the state have also been informed by the director of agriculture that pesticides remain in agricultural produce even after harvesting and until it is consumed. To prevent these residues, the department has issued control measures stating that pesticides remain in the atmosphere for a long time due to their slow decomposition process, or they dissolve in fat and accumulate in the body through the process of biomagnification. Farming directions while using pesticides The Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee (CIB&RC) has recommended measures regarding the use of pesticides in crops, including vegetables, fruits and spice crops. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have set maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticide residues in vegetables, fruits, grains etc. If the residue level is higher than the MRL, it can be harmful. If possible, fast-degrading agrochemicals such as Emamectin benzoate, Spinosad, Indoxacarb, and Novaluron should be used. The use of integrated pest management (IPM) will reduce the use of pesticides, which can help reduce pesticide residues. Household directions Insufficient care while using pesticides to control mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, ants and rats, among other pests at home, can lead to chemicals entering grains, water, flour, etc and their residues may enter our bodies, causing various diseases. When controlling such insects, water vessels, cereal storages, grain heaps, etc. should be covered with cloth or plastic before spraying pesticides. If the grain is found to be moist, it should be dried in the sun before use and should be stored in airtight containers.",gandhinagar

The bench, comprising Justices AS Supehia and Vimal K Vyas, directed the state government to issue a notification at the earliest for the establishment of new NDPS special courts. The High Court, making a scathing remark, observed that in 2015, the state government had issued a notification for NDPS courts in the state’s four metropolitan cities, but only one out of them is currently functional. Expressing concern over the pending cases of NDPS, the High Court bench stated, “The principle of speedy trial laid down by the Supreme Court is being violated as there is only one special court available to handle NDPS cases. Unless the state government issues a notification establishing more courts for such trials, this problem cannot be solved. There is an impending need for more courts.” Gujarat HC orders setting up NDPS courts The bench issued the order with several observations made during the hearing of an appeal filed by an accused convicted under the NDPS Act before the High Court. The appellant had raised the issue that “his trial under the NDPS Act was not conducted before a special NDPS court but by an Additional Sessions Judge of the general court.” It pleaded that the judgment passed by the judge cannot be sustained, as only the special NDPS court has the power to conduct trials for such cases. A judgment passed by an ordinary court is without jurisdiction and is liable to be set aside; read the plea. Taking into account the prevailing shortage of NDPS courts in Gujarat and the seriousness of this matter, the HC bench observed that “it is not enough to have only one special court for the trial of all NDPS cases in the state. Additional special NDPS courts should be established by the state government for the trial of cases under the NDPS Act.” The bench also urged the state government to issue a notification for this purpose as soon as possible and initiate the process. The High Court had granted time to the state government for the same over their request. Also read: 710 kg in 3 years!

The head-on battle between the BJP and the Congress party will further interest the masses, as the saffron party’s Dhaval Patel faces Anant Patel. Valsad registered a massive 75.22% polling in the 2019 general elections, with the BJP’s Dr KC Patel emerging as the clear winner with a 61.25% vote share. This year’s successively healthy voter turnout is reckoned to benefit the BJP, with Dhaval emerging to be the better of the two Patels. Banaskantha Amid the dull polling across the state, North Gujarat’s Banaskantha saw a heavy turnout, with the constituency registering a staggering 64.48%. While the seat mirrored the voter turnout of the 2019 general elections, the winning probability and margins are suspected to paint a different picture this year. Women power takes centre stage at this seat, as both the BJP and Congress have chosen to field female candidates. While the BJP’s Rekha Chaudhary brings a lineage of political and social prominence, Geni Thakor from Congress is known for her grassroots mobilisations. Notably, Congress has matched up their opponents in Banaskantha district in the assembly polls, bagging two seats, including Vav by Geni herself. The grand old party can turn the wave towards them, benefitting from this regional advantage. Chhotaudepur (ST) A tribal-dominated seat, reserved for the Scheduled Tribes (ST), witnessed a hefty voter turnout of 63.76%. The seat, predominantly held by the BJP, is set to witness another shift in parliamentarians, with the saffron party opting for Jashu Rathwa against Congress’ Sukhram Rathwa. A higher turnout may yield a 2019 repeat for the BJP, as the party recorded a landslide victory, securing a 62% vote share in the seat. Lower turnout equals plummeting BJP chances? Amreli The stage is set for a contest between Bharat Sutariya of the BJP and Jenny Thummar of the Congress in Amreli constituency, which saw a disastrous 45.59% voter turnout. Replacing its three-time MP on the seat, the BJP has fielded its local district panchayat’s president. This move, however, sparked an internal scuffle within the party’s regional faction. Against him stands Thumar, who aims to retain the seat once held by her family. A lower voter turnout may shrink the margins between the two parties. Porbandar A noteworthy battle is set to unfold between first-time electoral candidate and union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and Congress stalwart Lalit Vasoya. Vasoya, a local MLA and seasoned grassroots leader, may challenge Mandaviya’s stature, which has been prominent at the Centre since 2016. Porbandar’s lower voter turnout of 46.51% may play spoilsport for the BJP, as the seat saw a massive drop of 10% in voter turnout compared to last year. Vasoya’s Congress faction could benefit from this plunge. The assembly seat undergoing bye-polls in this parliamentary seat, Manavadar, also registered a significantly low polling rate of 48.45%.",gandhinagar

The same announcement has not been fruitful yet, as the recruitments are still to take place. The process is likely to extend till 2025, and after mandatory training, the joiners will appear for the job in 2026, five years after the announcement! Thus, a situation like 'Tarikh Pe Tarikh' has been created in Gujarat under the pretext of providing employment to the youth in police sub-inspector (PSI) and Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) cadre. The coaching centres for the recruitment exams were filled with enthusiasts in places like Gandhinagar, Surat, Rajkot, and across Gujarat as soon as the announcement was made in 2022, the year of Assembly elections in Gujarat. In 2024, the year of the Lok Sabha elections, advertisements referring to the same announcement were also made, inviting the candidates to apply for 12,472 jobs on Mar 12, 2024. Before this, the time was spent in the formation of the recruitment board and rules in 2023. Now, the chairperson of the recruitment board, Hasmukh Patel, tweeted that applications for LRD and PSI police sub-inspectors will take place in August-September again, and the candidates who were unable to apply before over educational qualifications or age can apply if they are eligible now. PSI Candidates are required to have a Bachelor's degree, and the LRD posts require the candidate to have cleared the Class 12. This received mixed reactions from candidates on social media, as one of the candidates, Brijesh Mishra wrote that new applicants will pose a significant challenge to the old ones, as already 15 lakh applications have been received for 12,000 posts. Concerns were raised on how the candidates preparing from the beginning have to start their preparation afresh every time. Some were even concerned about the time taken for the recruitment, requesting an age extension from the chairperson. Coaching fees of ₹30-40K, Gandhinagar becomes mini-Mukherjee Nagar Just in Gandhinagar, over 30 coaching centres offer classes for PSI preparations. These centres have fees ranging from ₹30,000 to ₹40,000, for three months of coaching. Sector 6 of the state capital becomes the epicentre for the candidates, giving away vibrations similar to Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar, which is known for the influx of Indian Administrative Services (IAS) aspirants. The paying guest (PG) accommodations, houses on rent, and libraries host these aspirants. In Gandhinagar, the prices for PG stand at a minimum of ₹7,000. Two government and 28 private libraries offer almost 1,100 seats to the dreamers, with private libraries having fees amounting to ₹1,200. Recruitment becomes campaign Not just the announcements, but the process of final recruitment has also turned political in the last few years. A senior police officer said that when they were recruited, the appointment letters came to their addresses through posts.

Hailstorm-accompanied unseasonal rains have already lashed parts of Dang district, including Saputara and Samgahan.

"Radadiya defies BJP candidate in IFFCO election, internal dissent intensifies",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/radadiya-defies-bjp-candidate-in-iffco-election-internal-dissent-intensifies,2024-05-12,12,05,2024,"Jayesh Radadiya, Dileep Sanghani Jayesh Radadiya, a former BJP minister and MLA, won the election for the post of director of the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) on May 9, defeating the BJP’s official candidate, Bipin Patel, who had the mandate of the party. This comes after Dileep Sanghani, who had also rebelled against the state leadership, was re-elected unopposed as chairman of IFFCO. A lack of coordination among the party is also seen to be evident as BJP’s Patel and Radadiya took a head-on battle against each other. Radadiya received a total of 113 votes, of which 68 were from Rajkot and Morbi districts, in addition to 45 votes from other districts, with 14 votes from outside Saurashtra. This acts as a shock to the BJP, as their candidate Patel, despite being considered close to Amit Shah, only secured 67 votes. IFFCO elections a blow to BJP? IFFCO elects 21 directors across the country, and these elections are not to be fought on any symbol or as a party candidate. Delegates of the cooperative groups cast these votes, which means that the result is decided over who possesses a fairer share of weight over each cooperative sector. Radadiya contested these elections against Patel of Gota, Ahmedabad, with the slogan that they cannot let someone else preside over where they have been sowing and cultivating for the last 30 years. This year’s IFFCO election results have supposedly exposed the lack of harmony  in the BJP, as its Saurashtra faction leaders stood successfully and emerged victorious, against the will of the party’s powerful leaders. Facing the tag of a rebel now in the BJP, Radadiya said, “I was elected unopposed in the last election. I already have the support of 68 representatives of the cooperative sectors of Saurashtra. I had filed my candidature on Apr 24 when Bipin Patel’s name was not even present. He filled out the form later, and suddenly there were talks of a mandate. I was not given any such mandate. I have won by a huge majority in the test of strength.” Notably, had Radadiya been re-elected unopposed this time too, the alleged Bipin Patel-BJP back-door mandate would not have surfaced. State BJP president CR Patil had issued mandates to BJP leaders in the cooperative sector a couple of years ago, stating that they were colluding with Congress. This had already sparked outrage in Saurashtra. Jayesh Radadiya’s rise among party ranks Radadiya, once considered a bright young leader of the party, has been seemingly sidelined for the past few years. Radadiya also lost his position in the state’s cabinet after the 2022 assembly elections. Efforts were reportedly also underway to cut him down to size in the cooperative sector. His rebellion is said to be against this cornering by his own party. The same treatment that was meted out to Radadiya is being said to have been meted towards several leaders in the party’s local and national factions. It remains to be seen who will take inspiration from Radadiya’s potency and follow suit. IFFCO chairman all out against BJP? Ahead of the unopposed re-election of Dileep Sanghani as IFFCO chairman, a video of him went viral in which he made serious allegations against defection and recruitment operations. He reportedly alleged that a Congress member in the morning, switches to the BJP in the afternoon, and gets a ticket. This is utter collusion. This victory of a leader from the cooperative sector against BJP’s official candidate, who too stated unawareness of the party mandate, clearly has initiated a ripple which may extend up to distances of major consequences. Bipin Patel’s flattering words for Dileep Sanghani Patel strikingly congratulated Sanghani, the re-elected chairman of IFFCO, by saying, “I would have been happier had Dileepbhai won the 2012 assembly elections for which he was given a ticket.” Notably, Sanghani had lost to Congress’s Paresh Dhanani in that election.",gandhinagar

Long queues have started forming after taxpayers complained that GMC was not acknowledging payments as received, even after funds were deducted from their bank accounts.

We have not had any problems with the technology, or with servers being down,” one official told Gujarat Samachar, adding that any failed online payments will be refunded within seven days. On average, paying property tax online takes about three minutes, if the system is working properly.

Barot was one of two Congress councillors—along with Gajendrasinh Vaghela—who jumped ship from the Congress to the Bharatiya Janata Party just before the Lok Sabha elections, leaving Tushar Parikh of the Aam Aadmi Party the sole member of the opposition. When it meets, the general assembly will also select the chairman of the standing committee and the leader of the ruling party. GMC was formed in 2011. by combining sectors 1 through 30 and seven adjoining villages. Nineteen villages were included later.

A Talati-cum-Mantri (Village panchayat secretary) of Bhadrala village in Godhra registered 100 fake marriages in just one month. An investigation found that over the last six months, the Talati registered 550 fake marriages and issued certificates for these unions. The scam is not limited to Godhra and officials said that fugitive couples from Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan were also involved in obtaining fake marriage certificates through the Talati. “The continuous rise of such cases in the state raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of marriage registrations. The Talati was not only involved in registering marriages within Godhra but also catered to fugitive couples from outside Gujarat,” sources added. The Talati of Bhadrala village has been suspended and the involvement of more people in the racket is being investigated.

Now, with regional transport offices (RTOs) reporting problems with their servers this past week, accessing services from the traffic commissionerate is becoming a nightmare. And with the position of transport commissioner lying vacant for more than two years, there is no one to hold accountable for the mess. Officials say the state’s RTOs deal with about 7,500 online applications a day—that’s roughly 27 lakh applications annually—most of which relate to the issuance of fresh licences or renewals. The Parivahan Sarathi website, used by the state’s RTOs, is hosted by the National Informatics Centre in New Delhi for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The local traffic commissionerate has no control over how it operated. Even if there was scope for intervention at the state level, it is likely that RTO applicants would still remain in dire straits given the lack of a traffic commissioner since IAS officer Rajesh Manju was made Principal Secretary to the Governor of Gujarat.  Manju, who had served as traffic commissioner until March 21, 2022, now handles the RTOs as commissioner in-charge, an additional post.

How Amreli’s Kesar mangoes made it to the White House,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/how-amrelis-kesar-mangoes-made-it-to-the-white-house,2024-05-23,23,05,2024,"Madhu Savani Mango (img: Savani Farms) After becoming popular across the world, Amreli’s famed Kesar mangoes found it tough to gain acceptance  in the United States, especially the White House, the official residence of the US president.. However, a teacher and his son’s undying efforts for 6 years made it possible to lift the ban on the export of Kesar mangoes from Gujarat. Today, former teacher Madhu Savani of Mota Bhamodra village in Amreli’s Savarkundla taluka is exporting hundreds of boxes of Savani Farm mangoes that have been loved by US presidents, including George Bush, Donald Trump, and the current president, Joe Biden. Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of New York and the wife of Prince Andrew too have relished the juicy fruit. Savani has planted 10,000 mango trees of different varieties on a 150-bigha (30-acre) orchard between Thavi and Virdi villages. During the maiden visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the US, Nancy Pelosi, once known to have cancelled Modi’s US visa, ordered 25 boxes of the mangoes from Savani farms and served him. From Amreli to America: a fruitful journey Similar to his mangoes, Savani has made a journey that stretches from the humble mango orchards in Gujarat to the ambitious markets of the US. Although he dons a white suit and a hat to his farm these days, Savani once resigned from his job as a teacher in Damnagar to send his son abroad for studies and eventually settled him there. He, too, shifted to the US. After securing his sons’ careers, Savani returned home and took up farming. As the story goes, once on a visit to  the US to see his son, he was forced to hide the Kesar mangoes he had brought along. However, the US airport authorities seized the bag and threw the fresh mangoes away, much to the teacher’s chagrin. As Savani’s mangoes couldn’t reach American soil, his son Bhaskar made innumerable pleas for ‘mango mandate’ to the White House and the Indian government from 2001 to 2007. After six long years of hard work, the US allowed the entry of Kesar mangoes into their country after fulfilling 183 quality checks. At the ripe old age of 85, Savani’s enthusiasm has not dimmed. He continues to tend to the 10,000 mango trees on his farm, driving around in a car and keenly supervising the farm labourers.

An official associated with GUVNL has clarified some of the misconceptions regarding the technology. According to the official, if only the meter shows a balance of -₹300, the electricity supply will be cut off between 10 am and 4 pm. Thereafter, when it is recharged, the electricity supply will resume within 15 minutes. As per the official, the installation of approximately 1.65 cr smart meters is on the cards in Gujarat. Over the past three months, the four companies under GUVNL have replaced 47,500 meters, with MGVCL replacing 27,700, DGVCL 11,800, PGVCL 7,000, and UGVCL 1,000 meters. The company aims to install prepaid meters across the state by March 2025. However, agricultural connections are excluded from this project. They further reason that the direct benefit of smart meters is that individuals can access their meter reading and remaining balance from anywhere. Several conditions are put in place by GUVNL for power cuts to ensure consumers are not inconvenienced. The company will refrain from cutting the electricity supply at night and on holidays. These smart meters add a communicative capability to the regular conventional meters. Consumers can download a mobile application to access their balance and usage. Moreover, this app provides a recharging portal where consumers can make payments using a UPI ID, QR code, or through the application itself. The smart meter will also send reminder messages to consumers regarding their available balance and recharge due dates.

In principle, the idea was solid. However, six financial years after the plan was first proposed in the state budget for fiscal 2019, there has been no progress on the issue. According to the original plan, the state education department would set up 86 secondary schools in non-tribal areas and 17 in tribal areas. On the ground, however, authorities realized that this plan wasn’t as feasible as they’d originally thought, given the lack of space to establish whole new schools. So they decided to start the new secondary schools by utilizing the existing primary-school infrastructure. The state education department has realized that it needs to rethink its whole resolution, given that most primary schools are in a dilapidated condition. As a result, the education department has decided to amend its general resolution on the subject, to provide three options. These are based on the condition of primary schools in which secondary schools had also been planned. Primary schools where the infrastructure is adequate, will see secondary schools operate on the same premises in separate shifts. In case school timings overlap or if the school building does not have enough proper classrooms, the primary school may construct an additional room in which the secondary school will operate. The third option is that, where possible, the state will procure land to build a separate secondary school building. The government has directed the Commissioner of Schools' office to monitor and oversee the necessary construction or land acquisition process for the successful implementation of the amended plan. And there’s the rub: Authorities will only acquire fresh land if the primary school does not have a “large piece of land” (read: playground) on its premises. This begs the question, if secondary schools are built on primary school playgrounds, and primary schools are too dilapidated for kids to study in, where are the younger children meant to go?",gandhinagar

The inspection team included officials of the Godhra city mamlatdar, the fire department, civil and mechanical engineering departments, the electricity distribution company, and the city police department. The investigation focused on several key aspects like verification of required permissions and licences, assessment of maximum occupancy limits, examination of electrical loads, cables, and installations, inspection of fire safety equipment, escape routes, and exit gates, and evaluation of the strength and fitness of mechanical installations. Their investigations revealed that the four game zone operations had multiple deficiencies and did not match safety standards. Now they are under investigation for violations and have been closed down. According to the report presented by the team, one game zone was in an open tent in Vavadi area on the Godhra-Dahod main road. It had not got its fire safety no objection certificate (NOC) for the last two years, resulting in its closure. Preliminary findings indicated that apart from the game zones lacking the necessary fire safety NOC, they all had issues with their traffic routes. A comprehensive report on these deficiencies will be submitted to higher authorities.

Coming a day after safety inspectors found open wiring in a hospital in Ahmedabad’s Shivranjani area, the video conference was attended by health department officials, representatives of 19 medical college-hospitals, 18 district hospitals, 57 sub-district hospitals, 328 community health centres. In all, 422 health institutions were represented in the discussion. During the meeting, health commissioner Patel made several suggestions on action healthcare institutions could take to ensure fire safety, including: holding periodic fire safety audits of fire safety committee constituted in health institutions. ensuring proper wiring as per electrical load, and conducting electrical audit in coordination with Project Implementation Unit. special checking of wiring in intensive care units. planning for immediate evacuation of debilitated patients, and those admitted in intensive care units.placing clearly visible fire exit signage and posters on do’s and don’ts in the case of a fire.installing necessary fire safety equipment, and periodically checking and replacing worn-out or outdated fire safety equipment.ensuring that fire NOCs are present, and up to date. conducting monthly fire mock drills with participation of all care staff. training all healthcare staff on fire safety, the use of fire equipment and what to do in the case of a fire. periodically checking that water is available in sufficient quantities. implementing emergency evacuation plans and ensuring that exit passages are unobstructed and lead to doors that open outwards.f Informing patients and their relatives about the emergency exits in case of a fire. In addition, Patel said that the hospital committee would verify the 36-item fire-safety checklist created by the Gujarat Institute of Disaster Management and forward updated information to all healthcare institutions in the state. The project implementation unit and fire department of each zone will coordinate while using fire safety equipment like sprinklers, fire alarms, sensors and fire safety systems.",gandhinagar

In state capital Gandhinagar, the post of the fire officer has been vacant for two years now, with another official filling in with additional charge of the post. Kaizad Mehernosh Dastoor, originally posted as divisional fire officer by Directorate of State Fire Prevention Services, handles the additional charge of Gandhinagar fire officer. There has been an increase in the area of ​​Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) with the addition of one municipality and 18 villages. However, there has been a blatant disregard for fire safety norms in residential and commercial buildings, many of which operate without a ‘No Objection Certificate’ from the department. The expanded GMC has 2 lakh properties registered with it and taxes are collected from them by the corporation, as per data shared by GMC’s property tax department. Moreover, Dastoor, who holds the additional charge is on leave, passing the charge to a sub fire officer, KJ Gadhvi. Why is Fire Officer’s post vacant? The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in January, 2022 raided Gandhinagar Fire and Emergency Services  Fire Officer Mahesh Mode and his associate Kamal Gadhvi for accepting bribes to clear the plans of two buildings in GIFT City and giving NOCs before inspection.

What rooftop restaurants? Gandhinagar officials clueless as unlicensed operations flourish,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/what-rooftop-restaurants-officials-clueless-as-unlicensed-operations-flourish,2024-05-30,30,05,2024,"The Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) seems content to maintain the status quo when it comes to fire safety, despite the recent knuckle-cracking by the state High Court. A quick internet search shows more than a dozen rooftop restaurants operating in areas under the GMC. Yet, officials in the estate, fire, and town-planning departments—the three bodies with the authority to oversee safety in public spaces—have no idea as to how many of these are even legal. Those familiar with the issue say that no such units have been given fire safety certifications in the past three years. In-charge fire officer KJ Gadhvi, who is filling in for Kaizad Dastur during the latter’s leave of absence, went on the backfoot when Gujarat Samachar pressed the issue. “The fire department has issued no-objection certificates (NOCs) to around 800 hotels, hospitals and other public spaces such as reading libraries. But the permission to run amenities such as rooftop restaurants comes from the town-planning department,” he said, passing the buck. GMC’s town-planning officer, Perez Christian, was not available for comment despite multiple texts and attempted calls from Gujarat Samachar. When asked if the GMC planned to monitor, inspect or regulate unlicensed rooftop restaurants, Hardik Tilwani, an estate department officer, also washed his hands of the issue. “Unlike in other municipal corporations, in Gandhinagar, the town-planning department gives such permissions,” he said. Municipal Commissioner JN Vaghela assured Gujarat Samachar Digital that action would be taken against unsafe public buildings, but was non-committal when asked for details. “We have started to take action against such unsafe public places. Right now, we are focused on things like basements and game zones. But rooftop restaurants have come to our notice. We will do a crackdown on such restaurants soon.” Rooftop restaurants that operate without proper certifications put patrons at severe risk in addition to the usual risks of fire that accompany a lack of proper safety measures like fire extinguishers, emergency exits and proper electrical wiring. A lack of proper ventilation in such kitchens to remove smoke, grease, and cooking fumes could lead to choking hazards and fast-spreading flames. Further, if the building is not meant to handle the stress of kitchen equipment, furniture and high foot traffic, it could potentially collapse causing a loss of life both in the building itself, and on the ground. Many rooftops also lack access to fire escapes, evacuation routes and proper sanitation facilities, adding to the potential risks. With this in mind, this laissez-faire approach of the governing body of the state capital is extremely concerning, especially coming in the wake of the fatal fire that claimed 28 lives in Rajkot on May 25.",gandhinagar

According to a recent CAG report, the state houses 183 operational fire stations against the requirement of 394, based on its population. The shortage of fire stations is further compounded by a severe manpower crisis. Gujarat’s fire department currently has only 1,447 fire personnel, against the required 4,240. This translates to a mere 34.5% staff. The state’s fire-fighting equipment and vehicles are also in short supply. Against a requirement of 1,467 fire vehicles, Gujarat has only 770 available. Of these, over 250 are non-functional or inoperative. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report has highlighted serious shortcomings in fire prevention measures across the state’s eight metropolitan cities and 153 municipal areas. The reports reveal that there is no record of when and by whom fire NOCs (No Objection Certificates) were obtained or renewed in these areas. Expressing concern over the state’s fire safety situation, Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) spokesperson Manish Doshi said, “The BJP government’s inaction is leading to the loss of lives due to frequent accidents in the state. The government has no fire policy or regulations. There is rampant corruption in the issuance of fire certificates/NOCs. The government remained dormant for five years after the Takshshila fire incident, resulting in frequent such incidents.

In the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress party fielded Sonal Patel, a seasoned political figure and former Gujarat Mahila Congress president, to contest from the high-profile Gandhinagar constituency against the incumbent MP, union home minister Amit Shah of the BJP. Gandhinagar saw a voter turnout of 59.19% on the polling day in phase III on May 7. This strategic decision came after Congress candidate CJ Chavda’s defeat in the 2019 elections, where HM Shah triumphed by a margin of 5.57 lakh votes. Sonal Patel, 62, an architect and town planner by profession, has a long history with the Congress party, having led its women’s wing and contested the 2022 Assembly elections from Naranpura, albeit unsuccessfully against the BJP’s Jitendra Patel. The Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency, one of Gujarat’s 26 parliamentary seats, holds a special status as the political epicentre of the state, which is also its capital. Established in 1967, it has been a platform for several prominent leaders including former prime minister, late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former deputy prime minister, LK Advani, and now home minister, Amit Shah. Since 1989, the constituency has largely been a stronghold of the BJP, starting with Shankersinh Vaghela’s victory that year. Senior leader Advani took over in 1991, followed by a significant moment in 1996 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee won but soon resigned to represent Lucknow, leading to a bye election victory for Vijay Patel over film actor Rajesh Khanna of the Congress. Gandhinagar has been distinguished by its high-profile representatives, including a prime minister and two home ministers, making it one of the most prestigious and closely-watched parliamentary constituencies in India.

Lok Sabha polls: A shift in dynamics in Gujarat?,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/lok-sabha-poll-results-a-shift-in-dynamics-in-gujarat,2024-06-04,4,06,2024,"BJP Congress in Gujarat The latest trends coming out of the Election Commission today show the BJP maintaining its dominance in Gujarat, securing 25 out of the 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state with the Congress ahead in the remaining one seat. The Congress made notable gains in Banaskantha, where its candidate Geni Thakor won against the BJP’s Rekha Chaudhari. This shift indicates a partial recovery for the Congress in a region where it has historically been competitive. The BJP’s tactical approach in selecting candidates and campaigning aggressively in key regions paid off, with Home Minister Amit Shah securing a substantial victory in Gandhinagar with more than 6.94 lakh votes, outstripping his closest rival INC’s Sonal Patel by a margin of 5.44 lakh votes. Similarly, Poonam Madam in Jamnagar and union minister Purshottam Rupala in Rajkot are likely to win with leads, showcasing the BJP’s stronghold over urban and semi-urban areas. Additionally, the party’s strategic focus on the tribal belt, a traditionally less favourable region, further consolidated its electoral base. The 2024 elections also highlighted a unique scenario in Surat, where the BJP candidate Mukesh Dalal was elected unopposed after the Congress candidate’s nomination was rejected, and the other contenders withdrew. Despite the overwhelming wave in favour of the BJP, the INC’s ability to lead in Patan and Banaskantha is significant. Patan, a constituency with a historical tilt towards the BJP, witnessed a surprising turnaround with Chandanji Thakor leading. This change is particularly striking when compared to the 2019 results where Bharatsinhji Dabhi of the BJP won with a huge majority. Similarly, Geni Thakor’s victory in Banaskantha showcases the INC’s resilience and suggests a potential recalibration of voter preferences in these regions. The history of electoral outcomes in Gujarat has predominantly favoured the BJP, especially under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Since his ascendance as prime minister, the BJP has capitalised on his popularity and the party’s development narrative to secure overwhelming victories in 2014 and 2019, achieving a clean sweep of all 26 seats in both elections. The Congress party’s struggles in Gujarat stem from several structural and strategic deficiencies. A lack of strong local leadership and an ineffective counter-narrative to the BJP’s governance model have often put it on the back foot. The electoral outcomes in 2014 and 2019 were reflective of these challenges, where the party failed to secure any seats. However, the gains in 2024 suggest a possible shift in strategy or voter sentiment that could pave the way for a more competitive political environment in future elections.

Envisioned as a means of backstopping whistleblowers, CARE sees ACB officials visit complainants in person, to ensure that they are not being harassed for filing a corruption complaint. As a result, ACB officials say, the conviction rate in corruption cases has touched 46% in the first quarter of the calendar year. “For instance, a Morbi Sessions court convicted the accused in three separate ACB cases on the same day. They were sentenced to jail and fined. In addition, cases pending before the high court are also being monitored by the Core Committee constituted under the chairmanship of the Additional Director,” an ACB official explained. “So far, we have contacted more than 900 complainants under the CARE programme. This has also helped raise complainants’ trust in the bureau, so more people are feeling empowered to reach out to combat corruption,” the official said, adding that the CARE programme stores information digitally, making it easily accessible for quick and efficient use. In addition to CARE, the bureau also uses the advice of legal, forensic, technical, revenue and financial experts to conduct thorough investigations into alleged cases of bribery and disproportionate assets and to collect evidence. The CARE programme is among the latest moves in the ACB’s continuous awareness campaign to involve the public in the fight against bribery and corruption in Gujarat’s government offices.

GST seva kendras weed out bogus applications,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gst-seva-kendras-weed-out-bogus-applications,2024-06-12,12,06,2024,"GST Seva Kendra The state has seen an almost 25% drop in applications for GST (goods and service tax) numbers, and officials say this is a good thing. Coming barely seven months after the launch of 12 centralized “GST seva kendras” in Gujarat, officials say the fall indicates better weeding out of bogus applications. Envisioned along the lines of passport seva kendras, the GST seva kendras are meant to streamline the registration process and curb tax evasion. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Nov 7, 2023, inaugurated one each in Vapi, Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Godhra, Mehsana, Palanpur, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Junagadh and Gandhidham. “Earlier, there were several cases in which unscrupulous people attempted to evade tax by using bogus documents to register for a GST number. This has now come down by 24.99% year-on-year,” one official said. The seva kendras offer a one-stop solution to both the department and taxpayers. Once someone applies for a GST number at a particular centre, they also have to register their biometrics there. The application is then scrutinized on the basis of more than 40 criteria, and the applicant is called in for in-person verification before being allocated a GST number, the official explained. As all operations related to biometrics, both for state and Central GST registration, go through these 12 centres, operations have become quicker, more efficient and more transparent, this official added.

"Disregarding rate contract, GMSCL orders medicines worth crores",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/disregarding-rate-contract-gmscl-orders-medicines-worth-crores,2024-06-12,12,06,2024,"Medicines A government body has allegedly caused a loss of over ₹2 crore to the government exchequer by procuring medicines at the old rate after expiry of the rate contract and extending the old contract of the supplier. Gujarat Medical Services Corporation Limited (GMSCL), which is responsible for procuring medicines for government hospitals in the state, placed an order for 9.5 crore paracetamol tablets on June 11. It has been decided to procure 80 crore of these tablets for the year. After the contract expired in January, the corporation had extended the old rate contract to the supplier company until November, allowing them to supply medicines at the old contract rate. This order is alleged to have incurred losses worth over ₹2 crore to the government treasury. Currently, these medicines are said to be available in the market at a 45% lower price. Currently, 1,000 tablets of paracetamol medicine are available in the market for ₹250. In contrast, GMSCL has paid ₹495 for this lot. In general, the practice for procuring medicines for government hospitals is to invite tenders and procure the best quality medicines at the lowest cost. When asked about the delay in opening the tenders launched in January, GMSCL’s Managing Director (MD) Ganga Singh said, “The time has not yet arrived for the tender launched in January.” Responding to a question about paracetamol being available in the market at half the price of the old rate contract, he said, “You provide evidence for that.” Compared to Gujarat,  the Odisha Medical Services Corporation Limited and Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited are procuring the paracetamol lot of 1,000 tables for ₹298 and ₹293 respectively. Odisha and Rajasthan have already issued and approved their tenders a short time ago, and these contracts have been approved after January. As the circumstances stand, GMSCL seems to be reluctant to procure medicines at lower prices. The medical services body floated fresh tenders in January to procure paracetamol and other medicines, but those tenders have not been opened yet. When asked about the delay in opening the tenders, IAS Ganga Singh said, “The tenders will be opened when their turn comes.” An official involved in the medicine tendering process said, “When the prices in the market have fallen, the heads of the respective departments usually do not not extend the old contract. Instead, the opposite is happening here.” The responsibility of placing medicine orders for GMSCL lies with deputy general manager Hitesh Prajapati. Purchasing lapses for essential tablets To overcome iron deficiency, iron-folic tablets are prescribed. The rate contract for these tablets, which are being purchased under code number 1379, is ₹153.70 for 1,500 tablets. Instead, the medicine is procured from Hindustan Laboratories for a price of ₹190.31 for 1,500 tablets. Despite being available at a lower price, an order for 48,890 boxes of 1,500 tablets each, costing over ₹93.31 lakh, has been placed. This has already been brought to the attention of Health Minister Rushikesh Patel. As many as 1,000 tablets of iron-folic tablets under code number 1378 are being purchased at a price of ₹126.87 per packet from Hindustan Laboratories. On the other hand, generic medicines of similar quality that offer 1,000-tablet packets are available at ₹103.80 per packet. An order of over 1.45 lakh boxes of 1,000 tablets each of this medicine, costing ₹1.84 crore, has also been placed.",gandhinagar

Of the 12 students, four students had deposited ₹66 lakh in the bank account of Roy Overseas Company run by Parashuram Roy of Vadodara while students had issued cheques of ₹2.82 crore to Tushar Bhatt and Parasuram Roy. The investigation also revealed that three students gave blank cheques to Bhatt and Roy. This suggests that a huge amount of money was taken from 12 students for alleged malpractices in the NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test) for UG medical courses. Depending on evidence regarding the role of the students and parents in the entire matter, the police will file charges against them. Accused’s bail hearing reserved Meanwhile, Tushar Bhatt, the prime accused in the NEET scam, filed a regular bail application before the District Court of Godhra. After hearing the bail application, the District Judge reserved his judgement. Earlier, Bhatt's regular bail plea was rejected by Chief Principal District Sessions Judge CK Chauhan on June 10. The court observed that the field of education is a sacred and noble profession. Conspiring to cheat with students in entrance examinations for higher education is an unforgivable activity. This directly affects the people of the entire country. Therefore, it is not a case where regular bail can be granted to those involved.

Disappointed by the lackadaisical attitude of the authorities, the bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Pravin Trivedi said, “There should be a disciplinary inquiry and fact-finding inquiry as to whose fault was there in every mishap.” “Three incidents of the recent past –Morbi bridge collapse, Harni boat capsize and Rajkot fire – have one thing in common, that municipal corporations are not working efficiently,” said the HC bench.

We will see from the first brick of the property.” “We are not accepting any affidavit of any commissioner or officer, the municipal secretary has to conduct a fact-finding inquiry from the first pillar laid till the day it was completed. We are issuing directions to the principal secretary of urban development and urban housing department to give a disciplinary report of the department, to constitute a high-level committee of three senior officials by June 16 and give an inquiry report by July 4,” directed HC. “Simultaneously, the principal secretary of the education department should constitute a team to carry out district-wise inspection of all categories of schools including pre-primary, primary, secondary, and higher secondary schools within one month,” added HC. The HC also emphasised that they are not waiting for the Special Investigation Team (SIT) report. “It is not a departmental authority, each authority will have to conduct a probe of every department working efficiently,” said HC. Regarding the photo that had gone viral on social media of officials attending the inaugural ceremony of TRP Game Zone in Rajkot, the HC rebuked the government, “Why have you not taken action against the officials who went to the inaugural function of TRP Game Zone? How could they go to a place which is illegally constructed, and if they are going, they at least know that there is a place like this.” “Without permission, electricity should not be supplied,” said the court.

This initiative, which directly responds to the tragic Rajkot TRP game zone fire, aims to prevent any similar incidents statewide. Rushikesh Patel also said that the government is seeking public input on these new safety regulations. Citizens can email their objections and suggestions regarding the rules to the Home Department at home@gujarat.gov.in by June 25. “Once finalised, the new regulations will be officially published. With these measures, the Gujarat government aims to enhance safety protocols and ensure that incidents like the Rajkot TRP (game zone) fire are never repeated,” Patel added. The proposed rules have been published on the home department’s website, where citizens can review them and provide feedback. These rules mandate that an amusement ride intended for operation for at least three months can be installed with prior permission from the licensing authority. Upon receiving the application, the licensing authority will forward it to relevant authorities for no objection certificates (NOCs) related to fire safety, building use, structural stability, health, sanitation, and electrical installations. The licensing authority will then consider recommendations from the city ride safety and inspection committee or the district ride safety committee before granting permission, which will be issued in Form B with specific terms and conditions, or the application will be refused in writing. Any major changes in design, specifications, or installation methods must receive prior approval. The licensing authority will issue a written direction specifying the approved deviations and any conditions to be complied with. Furthermore, the installation of amusement rides must be supervised by a qualified person, ensuring that all work and tests adhere to the authorised designs, specifications, installation methods, and conditions of the installation permit.

He also requested the public to use the 1930 helpline number to report such crimes to the CID branch as soon as possible. “We have received complaints regarding fraud totalling about ₹1,555.88 crore since 2020. Of this, fraud worth ₹346.07 crore—roughly 22.25%—could be prevented,” he said. Adding that most people only want to get their money back, but do not want to file first information reports (FIRs), he also shared that while a whopping 11,69,508 calls were received, only 2,80,272 formal complaints have been filed since 2020. Pandian also stated that people in Gujarat often fall prey to scamsters from other states and countries. Fake identity fraud, share market fraud, credit card fraud and phishing—where criminals masquerade as a legitimate business or reputable person to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a website—are the most common cybercrimes targeting Gujaratis, he said.

This approach proved its efficiency during the Biparjoy Cyclone in June 2023, ensuring zero casualties. Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, overlooking the disaster management situation in the state, mapped out a detailed communication plan, liaison, mobilisation of field support and shelter home arrangements, and post-disaster preparedness during the cyclone in 2023. Over 2.64 crore real-time messages were sent to people in the disaster-affected areas, thus providing timely and accurate information about a natural calamity to the masses to prevent casualties. During the cyclone, the State Emergency Operation Center (SEOC) sent weather updates from the Meteorological Department to all mobile phone users in the affected regions, which included Banaskantha, Kutch, Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Patan, Dwarka, Jamnagar, Morbi, and Junagadh. Cyclone shelters across Gujarat In pre-disaster preparedness, the Gujarat government constructed 76 advanced Multi-Purpose Cyclone Shelters (MPCS) in coastal regions, which have significantly contributed to ensuring zero casualties during the cyclones. The cyclone shelters, built at a cost of ₹271 cr, were spread across 10 districts: 25 in Junagadh, 29 in Gir Somnath, 4 in Porbandar, 4 in Devbhumi Dwarka, 4 in Kutch, 2 in Amreli, 1 in Jamnagar, 1 in Navsari, 5 in Bharuch, and 1 in Ahmedabad.

The rules state that a student must appear in at least two out of three examinations, including the first, second, and annual examinations, for promotion to Class 10. For promotion, a student must obtain at least 25% marks in each subject. The result of the annual examination will be prepared based on 100 marks. Students who obtain an ‘E’ grade will not be promoted. Students who obtain more than 33% marks in Classes 9 and 11 can be given grace marks at the rate of one mark per percentage point up to a maximum of 15 marks to pass. The examiner can give up to 10 grace marks for promotion to students who fail in more than one subject, but these marks must be shown separately and will not be counted for ranking.

This signifies that the surrounding area of GIFT City will become a real estate project. Out of the 1,065 acres of GIFT City, 741 acres is government land, and most of the land in the expansion area is private. Since the total 741 acres of land in GIFT City is a government wasteland, there was no special expense in land acquisition. However, since most of the land in the four villages - Shahpur, Ratanpur, Lavarpur, and Pirojpur - is private, the acquisition cost is likely to increase. GUDA will now develop the land in these four villages. According to a public notice issued by the state’s urban development department, GUDA will now implement its town planning scheme and new zoning plan covering the area outside GIFT City. GIFT City’s expansion is slated to include 2,300 acres of new land from its current area. The government has undertaken this step over numerous complaints and suggestions regarding building heights and Floor Space Index (FSI). The overnight change made by the state government may plummet the skyrocketing land prices around GIFT. Notably, the builder-developer lobby has purchased land at towering rates after GIFT City’s expansion was rolled out, which may now prove to be a jolt. This is the largest expansion of GIFT City since its planning in 2007. A senior GIFT City official said, “The expansion of GIFT is necessary due to increasing demand. Ahmedabad-based urban planner and architect Bimal Patel, who designed and constructed the new Parliament building in Delhi, has been tasked to prepare the master plan for this proposed expansion.” Moreover, the Ahmedabad Riverfront project is one of the projects coming up at GIFT City, alongside the metro rail.

Speaking to reporters in Bengaluru, Patil said, “If this applies to Gujarat, the same formula should be followed in other states as well to create more opportunities.” Patil also said that if a company is given this much incentive, it could be considered a public-sector undertaking (PSU). “It could be a welcome step if higher incentives are extended to create a conducive industrial ecosystem. So this policy should be the same for other states as well. However, currently, the Central government’s approach seems to only favour Gujarat, which is the prime minister’s home state,” said Patil, as he expressed concern that this could lead to a disparity among the states. Patil’s statement comes a day after Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy reportedly raised concerns over the investments made by companies like the US-based Micron Technology, which touched the $2.5 bn figure for a semiconductor unit in Gujarat. He presented an argument that this deal would incur a subsidy bill of ₹3.2 cr for each job it creates. Further adding to his statement given at a television programme of a news media house, Kumaraswamy said that this unit will generate “about 5,000 jobs.”. Against which, as he pointed out, the company “will fetch $2 bn in subsidies.”. As per his calculations, this translates to 70% of the total investment made by the company. In a pledge to “safeguard the nation’s wealth,” he mentioned tackling matters such as how many jobs these firms have created and what benefits the government has provided to them. Notably, clarifying this statement today, Kumaraswamy posted on X, ""Semiconductor is a strategic industry. It is a basic requirement for electronics and automobile manufacturing. Both these sectors generate lots of employment. I greatly appreciate the semiconductor-related initiatives taken by @PMOIndia and will work towards fulfilling them through my ministry.” (With inputs form syndicated feed)",gandhinagar

As per visuals of the protests doing rounds on social media, the authorities and police are seen dragging the aspirants and protestors on the roads of Gandhinagar near Sachivalay Bhavan (State Secretariat). It has been a year since the state government introduced the Gyan Sahayak Bharti policy (gyan sahayak recruitment policy) for the recruitment of contractual teachers. Instead of conducting permanent recruitments, the government has been implementing a temporary hiring plan for gyan sahayaks , leading to protests and dissatisfaction among the passed-out aspirants. Many positions in primary, secondary, and higher secondary schools remained vacant as thousands of candidates were not ready to join the recruitment for only 11 months.

On June 19, during a BJP gratitude event in Prachi village of Gir-Somnath, Chudasama made a contentious remark: “In five years, I will not spare those who have hindered me.” Following a backlash, he issued a clarification the next day in Junagadh. He explained, “I was referring to non-political individuals who opposed me despite the work I did for them over the past 10 years.” Chudasama reiterated his warning, emphasising, “Whether the BJP keeps account or not, I will not spare those who have hindered me in the past five years.” He acknowledged the hard work of BJP workers and leaders who contributed to his victory under challenging conditions. However, he expressed frustration over individuals who opposed him during the election despite him assisting them, finding their actions particularly painful. Defending his controversial remarks, Chudasama stated he was addressing a specific coterie, unrelated to his party. He also raised concerns about a potential lack of support in the future.

Short-staffed but not hiring: The puzzling gap in Gujarat’s recruitments,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/short-staffed-but-not-hiring-the-puzzling-gap-in-gujarats-recruitments,2024-06-22,22,06,2024,"TET-TAT protests In response to protests by candidates who have cleared the TAT and TET recruitment exams, the Gujarat government recently announced that it would hire 7,500 teachers to permanent positions. While this may appear to have been a victory for the protesters, it falls far short of addressing the state's education crisis: 1,600 schools in Gujarat operate with just one teacher, and the state faces a staggering shortage of 30,000 educators. The government’s laxity in hiring spans other departments, including health, home, panchayat, and even labour, as well. For instance, the Gujarat government has disregarded the Centre’s suggestion that it hire 32,000 police personnel, and announced plans to recruit 12,000 personnel. There has been no update on when these appointments can be expected to occur. Government hospitals in districts such as Dahod do not have doctors, thanks to the high number of vacancies for Class 1 Medical Officers. According to government data, there are 1,250 vacancies for surgeons, physicians and paediatric posts in the state. This is not a new issue. As previously reported by Gujarat Samachar Digital, as much as 90% of rural medical positions lie vacant. According to Rural Health Statistics data, Gujarat needed 1,088 surgeons, OB-GYN (obstetrics and gynaecology) specialists, physicians and paediatricians in 2005, but only 92 positions were filled. As of 2022, only 9.22% (127 of a total 1,376) positions had been filled. The government last held a recruitment drive for talatis (revenue officials) in 2018. Since then, there has been no effort made to fill the roughly 18 vacant positions of talati and junior clerk. As a result, there are a number of talatis who are each responsible for several villages. Coming back to the education department, no new yoga teachers or music teachers have been appointed since 2012. Further, there are currently 102 vacancies for the post of principal, 1,152 for that of professors and 132 vacant librarian positions in Gujarat’s 283 grant-in-aid colleges. Similarly, 19 Class 1 positions, 269 Class 2 positions, and 220 Class 3 positions vacant in government colleges. The Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries says that to recruit is to find new people to join a company or an organisation, while to hire is to actually give somebody a job. So, maybe, the government is being very specific in its recruitment announcements. Or, maybe, the state is using appointment announcements as a sop to quell agitations. Either could be true. After all, even the labour and employment department, which is responsible for creating jobs, is itself short-staffed by 50%!",gandhinagar

They told me, ‘We will fight’.” Notably, internal conflicts of the BJP have been rife in Manavadar for quite some time.

Government spokesperson and minister Rushikesh Patel—whose portfolios include law and justice—made the announcement following a cabinet meeting led by Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel on Tuesday, Jun 25. He said the new provision has been added to determine the responsibility of officers of the law and government officials. “Even if the case is strong on merits, the new provision will help establish if an officer is responsible for negligence or failure to provide sufficient information, and what, if any, action should be taken against him or her,” he explained.

Witch hunt or new playbook? ACB’s tactics could hit conviction rates further,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/witch-hunt-or-new-playbook-acbs-tactics-could-hit-conviction-rates-further,2024-06-26,26,06,2024,"Anti-Corruption Bureau Is the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) straying from its mandate? The body, initially meant to prevent graft and improve morale, now seems to be on a witch hunt, targeting specific officials over disproportionate assets. Further, recent cases have seen the ACB ignore standard operating procedures (SOPs), in a move that could potentially lead to fewer convictions. This is bad news given the already abysmal conviction rate of 37%. This month alone, persons close to the development shared that the ACB has filed at least three targeted cases of disproportionate assets. For instance, on June 12, a case was registered against Ajay Chauhan, former captain of Gujarat State Aviation Infrastructure Co. Ltd (GUJSAIL), alleging disproportionate assets worth ₹72 lakh. On June 19, it filed a case against planning officer MD Sagathia, an accused in the Rajkot TRP Gamezone fire, alleging disproportionate assets worth more than ₹10 crore. And, on June 21, it filed a case of disproportionate assets of ₹4.7 crore against Ruchi Bhavsar, then executive accountant of Gujarat Informatics Ltd. According to the SOP, the ACB needs the state government’s approval before checking the assets of Class 1 officers. If it gets this approval, ACB officials then make inquiries regarding the assets in question, both with the accused and with private sources. They also seek information—in writing—from the Regional Transport Office (RTO) and revenue officials regarding vehicles and land owned by the accused. And also reach out to banks. insurance companies and the Bureau of Immigration to gather information on investments, financial transactions and foreign travel. A crime is registered only if an analysis shows that the officer’s assets are more than 10% greater than their income. Even then, the police are expected to consult the ACB’s chartered accountant after their initial investigation and—in the case of any discrepancies—come to a consensus on the total amount of assets before filing an FIR. The problem here is that none of the three cases mentioned above followed the prescribed SOP, leading to questions of fairness and the motivation behind such hurried filings. In addition, by not following the proper procedures, the bureau may well be setting itself up for failure once these cases reach the courts. Given that Indian law considers the accused innocent until proven guilty, the burden of proof lies entirely with the prosecution. This means that the prosecution needs to be able to conclusively prove that the accused's wealth exceeds their known sources of income. Without following proper procedures, building a robust case becomes challenging. Evidence that is not collected legally and systematically may be ruled inadmissible in court. Similarly, not following SOPs could give defence counsel opportunities to challenge the investigation's validity, potentially leading to case dismissals or acquittals.

"Gujarat Tourism dept takes people for a ride, declares inflated figures for publicity’s sake",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-tourism-dept-takes-people-for-a-ride-declares-inflated-figures-for-publicitys-sake,2024-07-09,9,07,2024,"There was a 17 per cent increase in the number of tourists who visited Gujarat between April 1 and June 10, this year as per the figures released by the state government. The 12 tourist destinations, including  pilgrimage sites promoted by the state saw a footfall of 1.35 crore tourists, compared to 1.14 crore tourists in the corresponding period last year, as per the Gujarat Information Department. It has now come to light that there is no system in place to separate the tourists from the visitors. So, the inflated figures released by the tourism department seem to be an eyewash. The Gujarat Tourism department has released statistical data to suggest huge footfalls at the tourist destinations. Sources, however, said these figures have not been collated by calculating the actual tourist numbers. The department has no such system or technology to separate the tourists from the general population, devotees, workers, business persons or commuters. As per the figures released by the Tourism department, 61.44 lakh tourists visited 12 tourist places in Gujarat in April 2024 and 73.87 lakh in May 2024, compared to 52,30,675 tourists in April and 62,60,273 in May, 2023. Among the 12 tourist places, pilgrimage sites such as Pavagadh, Ambaji, Somnath and Dwarka temples have also been included. For the development of pilgrimage places, a separate Gujarat Pavitra Yatradham Vikas Board has been set up, yet the tourism department uses the board’s figures to promote its own numbers. . Now, the Yatradham board is planning to develop a system to count the actual number of pilgrims visiting these religious places. As per highly placed sources, the board has floated a tender for a pilot project to determine the accurate number of pilgrims visiting a site. If it is successful, then it will be implemented at all the pilgrimage sites in the state, the sources said. However, there is no clarity on how the Tourism department arrived at the record figures it released and what method was used to determine the footfalls. As per the department, Ahmedabad is a hot tourist destination, so much so that 23,06,591 passengers on Ahmedabad Metro in April-2024 and 25,47,534 passengers in May-2024 have all been termed as tourists. Tourism department also stated that 4.26 crore tourists visited Ahmedabad district and 2.25 crore tourists visited Ahmedabad city in 2023-24. Among the 12 tourist attractions in the state listed by the Tourism department are Statue of Unity (SoU), Atal Bridge, Riverfront-Flower Park, Kankaria Lake, Somnath Temple, Ambaji Temple, Pavagadh Temple, Dwarka Temple, Science City-Ahmedabad, Vadnagar, Gir and Devalia Safaris, and Ahmedabad Metro railway.",gandhinagar
"No punishment, only early retirement for corrupt Gujarat babus",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/no-punishment-only-early-retirement-for-corrupt-gujarat-babus,2024-07-09,9,07,2024,"Image made with AI Grappling with corrupt babus, systemic frauds and unaccounted funds worth crores, the Gujarat government has prepared a list of 100 corrupt officials. The list has been compiled by the Gujarat Vigilance Commission based on applications and complaints received by the Lokayukta and Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). As per the report, the majority of complaints of corruption were against the urban development and the revenue department, followed by the panchayat and home departments. Sources said that though the government has listed the names of the corrupt officials, they are still far from finding a strict action plan to fix the corrupt babus. In the past 15 days, the state government has handed forced  retirement to five Class 1 or IAS cadre officers facing complaints of irregularities, as per reports. On July 5, the state ordered the early retirement of the finance department’s D P Neta and S H Gandhi, both Class 1 officers serving as Deputy State Tax Commissioners. It has also enforced the premature retirement of a  Class 1 Gujarat Administrative Service (GAS) officer S J Pandya. Gujarat DGP Vikas Sahay ordered the retirement of D D Chavda, R R Bansal, and F M Kureshi on July 4. The three cops were facing departmental inquiry and had criminal cases against them. The series of suspensions and immediate retirements lead to administrative tensions in the government, plagued by allegations of corruption. Currently, the ACB is probing Rajkot’s suspended town planning officer (TPO) Mansukh Sagathiya over possession of  disproportionate properties beyond his known sources of income. The state also transferred his brother K D Sagathiya from the post of Additional Chief Town Planner (ACTP) to the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board (GIDB) on July 7. With over a hundred names of corrupt officials , and more complaints piling up, it needs to be seen if the state government continues with its process of early retirements, or takes solid action against the corrupt government servants who are looting tax-payers money.

Around 15,000 people residing in 4,000 houses in the area are highly inconvenienced due to GUDA’s alleged mismanagement, even as fear of a disease outbreak prevails during the monsoon. The stench emanating from GUDA’s sewage treatment plant is affecting the livelihood of five societies located in the Gandhinagar-Ahmedabad border area. Locals allege that diseases like dengue also spread rapidly due to unsanitary conditions. Some blocks of these societies fall under the Jaspur Gram Panchayat, while others are under the Dantali Gram Panchayat. Notably, there are two sewage treatment plants near these societies – an old and a new one – both under GUDA. The secretary of the Water Lily Society said, “The societies had informed the authorities about this issue. Authorities visited and assured us that the sewage treatment plant would be upgraded with sufficient technology to resolve the problem. However, there is also an old sewage treatment plant behind this society. Initially, there were talks of closing down the old plant and starting a new one. But now, both plants are operational. The sewage from entire Gandhinagar is treated in these plants, and since there is no facility to recharge this water, it is discharged into the open fields and vacant land nearby. This water then flows into society. This causes a terrible stench and a severe mosquito menace.” Another resident said, “When we came here to buy a house, we were told that there was a forest reserve behind, and we could spot animals like deer and nilgais. But the situation is now quite the opposite. There is only the stench of dirty water and the nuisance of insects to experience.” The plant is owned by GUDA and is managed by the Roads and Building Department, which also constructed the plant. Residents allege that, despite repeated complaints, no concrete action has been taken. Action was taken regarding this plant and its water discharge issue during 2021–22, but no arrangements for the discharge of this water were made thereafter.",gandhinagar

On the budget mentioning jobs for five crore youth in next five years, he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised two crore jobs for youth every year back in 2014. “There is nothing for Gujarat’s farmers in the budget, but the import duty on ammonium nitrate is increased by 10%, making it more expensive for the farmers,” he said. “Despite having a Gujarati Prime Minister, Gujarat has been treated unfairly and neglected in this budget. This budget is to ‘save the government and increase inflation’.”",gandhinagar

Surya had reportedly eloped with a gangster based in Tamil Nadu over six months ago. In the suicide note written in Tamil, she claimed to be unaware of the criminal background of the gangster Maharaja Perumal alias ‘High Court Maharaja’, with whom she had opened a salon in partnership. Surya had eloped to Tamil Nadu after a brief relationship with the gangster, leaving behind her husband and two sons. In Tamil Nadu, she was embroiled in a criminal case involving Maharaja and his associate Senthil Kumar when his gang allegedly kidnapped a boy on July 11 due to a financial dispute with the boy’s mother. They demanded a ransom of ₹2 crore from the mother. However, Madurai police were able to rescue the boy. As Surya’s name was also disclosed in the kidnapping case, she knocked on the doors of her IAS officer husband’s residence in Gandhinagar. IAS Ranjeeth Kumar refused her entry and informed the Madurai and Gandhinagar police about Surya’s arrival in Gandhinagar. Before the police could apprehend her, Surya ingested poison.

As per complaint by the residents who have lived here for 47 years, a block of 4 bighas was put up for sale, without their knowledge. Earlier this month, a similar scam came to light when a raw entry was made for sale of land belonging to Juna Pahadia village in Dehgam. Gandhinagar Local Crime Branch has already made arrests in this matter. In both cases, a sale document for the land was made without the knowledge of the residents. Scams related to land are becoming a norm in Gujarat, as cow grazing land worth ₹20,000 crore in Mulasana village was allegedly handed over to builders, leading to the arrest of former Gandhinagar collector S K Langa’s arrest.

Gujarat to introduce law to seize properties of corrupt babus,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-to-introduce-law-to-seize-properties-of-corrupt-babus,2024-07-26,26,07,2024,"Image made with AI In the upcoming monsoon session of the state assembly, discussions are brewing to enact a robust law to confiscate the properties of corrupt government officials. The central government had enacted a law 12 years ago to confiscate the properties of corrupt officials who had retired. The state government is now drafting a similar law for officials and employees who engage in corruption even during service. There is a possibility that a bill regarding this matter will be introduced in the upcoming monsoon session of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly likely to be held between Aug 21 and 23. Family property also on the list According to reports, the government may be taking such measures after  cases akin to corrupt former town planning officer (TPO) of Rajkot, Mansukh Sagathiya. Sagathiya was charged with disproportionate assets. However, under the proposed law, the government can confiscate all properties and assets as soon as a case of disproportionate assets is filed. Currently, the laws are allowing the seizure of corrupt properties after going through court procedures. However, under the new law, the government will be able to confiscate disproportionate properties immediately after the case is filed. Additionally, stricter rules for bail may also be established. Similar laws were passed in Odisha in 2006 and Bihar in 2009, but were stayed by the Supreme Court upon an appeal. The proposed law will allow the confiscation of properties not only of the corrupt officials but also of their family members and any properties purchased under their names. Cases of corruption in Gujarat According to the latest report from the Gujarat Vigilance Commission, a total of 12,049 complaints of corruption were registered in just one year across 21 departments of the Secretariat, with the highest number of complaints being 2,996 in the urban development department and 1,735 in the revenue department. In 2020, the commission registered 8,373 complaints and recommended actions against a mere 983 officials.

The so-called “hub of infotech” and “development” is now reportedly becoming a popular venue for drug-fuelled raves that last well into the night. Ahead of New Year’s Day, the state government introduced liquor access permits and temporary permits for visitors at ₹1,000 per annum to attract investments. The access to legal alcohol had the desired effect of increased club memberships and youth interest in working there. However, a recent “Nightwave” event on July 20–21 has sparked comparisons to Goa’s techno party scene. Political parties allege that this  was the most recent in a string of “late-night drug-fuelled” parties organised at GIFT City, under the guise of techno events. Cops in the know? These allegations come amid a recent crackdown on drugs in Gujarat, with at least three operations targeting party drug mephedrone (MD drugs) in the past two weeks. Questions have also arisen about police awareness of these activities in the dry state’s capital city. GIFT City’s apparent evolution from a financial hub to an emerging nightlife destination presents a complex challenge for law-enforcement authorities. Balancing the state’s dry status and anti-drug stance with the push for economic growth and youth appeal creates a delicate situation. The coming months may prove crucial in determining whether GIFT City can maintain its development goals while addressing these emerging concerns about late-night revelry and alleged substance abuse.

He was in the US to visit his daughter. At the time of his retirement, he was posted as the Additional Chief Secretary of the state’s home department. Throughout his career, he made numerous decisions that were significant for the welfare of the people. He was Chief Minister Narendra Modi's Chief Secretary in 2012,  and was also posted as chairman and managing director at state-run PSU Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals (GSFC) Ltd. Born on Feb 1, 1956, Dr Nanda held several important positions during his tenure with the state government. His services in the health department were frequently praised. He was noted for overseeing relief efforts during the Bhuj earthquake in 2001 and ensuring that an epidemic did not spread after the disaster. He significantly contributed to government policies related to Ayurveda, tribal development, and blood donation. In the state’s remote areas, where communication was lacking, he introduced the ham radio system. A 1978 batch officer, Nanda served as Assistant Collector and Collector at the field level in the districts including Dang, Vadodara, Panchmahal, Banaskantha, and Junagadh. During the water scarcity in 1984, the drought situation in 1985-86, and various disasters, he worked commendably in the fields of health, water, law and order, environment, and afforestation. In the government, besides health and home, he worked in several departments including civil supplies, tourism, forests, and environment. He was a strong contender for the position of Chief Secretary of Gujarat. However, after the retirement of Chief Secretary Varesh Sinha, the state government appointed him as the MD of GSFC in 2014 and chose Dr DJ Pandian for the position. Originally from Jagannath Puri (Odisha), Nanda chose to reside in Gandhinagar after his retirement.

Kantharpura Mahakali Vad: Gujarat’s religious heritage under sheer neglect,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/kantharpura-mahakali-vad-gujarats-religious-heritage-under-sheer-neglect,2024-07-29,29,07,2024,"Kantharpura Mahakali Vad Once known as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet project, the development of the Kantharpura Mahakali Vad in Dehgam, Gandhinagar, has come to a standstill. There have been allegations of grave negligence in the development of this area ever since Modi moved to Delhi. No CM, minister, or leader from the ruling party thereafter has shown keenness in the project. The initial plan included the protection, nurturing, and development of this vast 500-year-old banyan tree, spread over 2.5 acres. However, departments like Roads and Buildings, Estate, Forest, and the Gujarat Pavitra Yatradham Vikas Board (GPYVB) are said to have made negligible progress for it. In a recent occurrence, several branches of the tree broke off. Villagers, especially the trustees and priests of the Mahakal temple, have been making efforts to protect the tree. Kantharpura in the shadow Local villagers, priests, and the trustees of the Kantharpura Mahakal temple allege that officials visiting the site don’t care enough to meet the villagers or listen to their concerns. A construction project, allegedly to be developed as a museum, has been built near the temple. The president of the temple trust said, “Officials are only interested in the museum. They come, see the incomplete museum, take pictures, and leave.” Villagers complain, “The road has not been built, a market has come up under the shade of the banyan tree, but it is not being removed, there is no sanitation or drinking water facility for people, and no parking. The dharamshala has been demolished and a museum structure has been built, but there is no certainty when it will be completed.” Locals and elders of the village allege, “If we had been given the responsibility of protecting the tree and its branches, it would not have broken like this. The government has done nothing and has not allowed us to do anything. We are angry that a government that talks about religion is only filling its pockets.” A path to faith erased off govt records Some time ago, the government took over the administration of the temple and its surroundings for ‘development purposes’. The bus stand near the temple and a large water tank in front of it were demolished without any alternative arrangements, allege the villagers. Over time, as the tree grew and its branches bent, a branch that blocked the entrance to Kantharpura bent further, and buses were no longer able to pass under it, forcing the closure of the bus stand. The temple authorities have to order 40-50 pots of water daily, and during festivals, a tanker of water is ordered daily. The government departments have not even provided basic toilet facilities for people. A mobile toilet has been placed behind the temple, which is filthy, and there is no facility to clean  it. Notably, the road connecting Kantharpura village and the Mahakal Vad temple is also in a dilapidated condition. A resident of Kantharpura village and the president of the temple trust said, “We went to Gandhinagar several times and talked to GPYVB and Roads and Buildings Department officials about the development of our village road, but no one is bothered. Some shameless officials even tell us that ‘if Modi told you that the village road would be developed, then bring the map and papers from him. Our documents don’t show your village roads on the map’.” A borewell has been suddenly dug up on this 500-metre road. Instead of digging a borewell behind the museum, it was dug in the middle of the road, causing inconvenience to people. Villagers allege that crores of rupees have been granted, but no development is reflected whatsoever. They allege that the government did not build even a small room for the temple priest for three years, and when the temple trust and villagers built it on their own, the officials pressured them, claiming that they had built the room illegally. Notably, after reports from Gujarat Samachar, the authorities have swung into action and initiated the procedure to remove the encroachments surrounding the banyan tree. However, local traders operating there have demanded alternative arrangements for them. Under the shed of divinity The banyan tree, with the Mahakali Goddess temple houses below, holds immense faith among its followers and sees people from around the globe converging to offer prayers and fulfil their vows every year. A temple priest said, “More than 500 years ago, there was a statue of Mahakali Goddess among the banyan trees in Kantharpura village. Some villagers would go among the banyan trees and light lamps and offer prayers. It was difficult for the villagers to worship. People sought the permission of the goddess and cut some branches of the tree, and this temple was constructed right below it. There are two idols of the goddess in the temple. The old idol has been kept at the new spot, while a new idol has been placed in the old spot where priests worshipped.”",gandhinagar
Dalits protest in Gujarat’s capital over police misinterpreting SC verdict,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/dalits-protest-in-gujarats-capital-over-police-misinterpreting-sc-verdict,2024-07-30,30,07,2024,"Dalits in Gujarat’s capital Gandhinagar today protested against the police over the misinterpretation of a judgment that allegedly benefits the accused under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. A delegation gathered at the Director General of Police (DGP) office in Gandhinagar, claiming that the police had misinterpreted the Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar judgment, where the power of arrest by the police was questioned. In an application submitted to the DGP, Dalits said that due to the misinterpretation of this verdict, the police do not make arrests in the crimes reported under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, despite these offences not allowing anticipatory bails. This not only benefits the accused but also leads to the complainants facing more atrocities, opined the protestors. The National Dalit Rights Forum suggested that clear instructions regarding the matter should be conveyed to the police by the DGP. After a meeting with the DGP, the protestors said that a circular would be issued by the department to its officials in two days. If the department fails to do so, the agitation will continue. What was Arnesh Kumar vs the State of Bihar verdict of 2014? The case of Arnesh Kumar vs Bihar curbed the power of police to arrest, where Arnesh Kumar, seeking anticipatory bail, went to the Supreme Court when the lower courts did grant him bail. Kumar was granted anticipatory bail by the apex court. In its judgment, the court said, “Law Commissions, Police Commissions and this court in a large number of judgments emphasised the need to maintain a balance between individual liberty and societal order while exercising the power of arrest.” “Police officers make arrests as they believe that they possess the power to do so. As the arrest curtails freedom, brings humiliation and casts scars forever, we feel differently. We believe that no arrest should be made only because the offence is non-bailable and cognisable and therefore, lawful for the police officers to do so. “The existence of the power to arrest is one thing, the justification for the exercise of it is quite another. Apart from power to arrest, the police officers must be able to justify the reasons thereof. No arrest can be made in a routine manner on a mere allegation of commission of an offence made against a person,” it said. The judgment further stated that “it would be prudent and wise for a police officer that no arrest is made without a reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to the genuineness of the allegation”.",gandhinagar

The death of three students in a flooded basement at Rau’s IAS Coaching Center in Delhi prompted authorities to seal another institute for violating building norms. However, similar safety issues persist in Gandhinagar. While the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation has closed restaurants operating in basements following the TRP Game Zone incident in Rajkot, libraries and accommodations for exam candidates remain unchecked. Such basement libraries continue to operate in Gandhinagar’s Sectors 2, 3, and 8, occupying spaces meant for storage or parking. Further complicating the situation, many PG (paying guest) facilities operate illegally in residential buildings, often without proper student registration at local police stations. Aspiring candidates, many from outside Gandhinagar, pay ₹1,200–₹1,500 for library access, alongside substantial fees for coaching and accommodation. An aspiring constable from Surendranagar reported monthly expenses of ₹6,000 for PG accommodation, ₹1,500 for library use, and up to ₹25,000 for coaching classes. Coming as it does in the wake of preventable tragedies such as the New Delhi flooding on July 27 and the Rajkot TRP Game Zone fire on May 25, this ongoing situation in Gujarat’s capital raises serious questions about student safety and regulatory oversight.

The application, addressed to the secretary’s office, has been forwarded to the General Administration Department, which in turn sent it to the Revenue Department. It mentions the cancellation of an online application to convert land in Palanpore to NA (non agriculture). It alleges that the cancellation of the application clearly points to corruption in the matter. The application alleged that the then Collector Aayush Oak had taken such controversial decisions in several lands in Surat and committed corruption, in collusion with a mamlatdar, who allegedly sought bribe from the applicant of the Palanpore land. It mentions that officials working in the collector’s office during Oak’s tenure, who earned through illicit means, have made investments abroad, and purchased jewellery. The application seeks confiscation of such property after an investigation. Ayush Oak is currently suspended in a suspected land scandal.

According to the sources, the protest took place after the candidates’ meeting with a top official of the government. No permission to protest was granted by Gandhinagar police. The candidates were not happy with the results that were announced recently. They cited issues with the language of the test, technical glitches, variations in difficulty levels and the method used to process scores as flaws in the system. They said that the CBRT contains a high number of language errors. “It seems like no one at the private agency hired to programme the test, which is in Gujarati, knows Gujarati. So they use computer applications to translate the questions and don’t cross check them,” one aspirant said, adding, “Meaning often gets lost in translation.” Following that, Gandhinagar North MLA Ritaben Patel and Sanjaysinh Mahida of Mahudha had submitted a written submission to the government to scrap the CBRT method from the forest department recruitment and increase the number of posts. Top officials, including crime branch inspectors, sector 7 police inspectors, deputy superintendent of police of Gandhinagar, and a police staff of around 50 were present at the Ram Katha maidan to tackle the agitation.

But what happens when it’s the teachers who are shirking their classroom duties? This is the case in Gujarat, the Estimates Committee of Vidhan Sabha told the education department. The committee found that teachers who were serving as office-bearers in their respective unions were often found to be absent from class. As a result, the education department has now instructed district-level education officers to crack down on absenteeism. “Details regarding poor attendance and irregularity among representatives of secondary and higher secondary education unions have come to the attention of the Estimate Committee,” the order states. It adds that education officers in each district are to take measures and appropriate “action to ensure regular performance and regular attendance in the school” with immediate effect.

However, the police have intensified their stance, detaining the protesters within 10 minutes of their arrival at the Gandhinagar Secretariat. Recently, the government announced that it would hire 24,700 newly minted teachers across the state, including 7,500 for classes 9–12. The protesters — candidates who have qualified in the TET/TAT (Teachers’ Aptitude Test/Teachers’ Aptitude Test) — have demanded that 15,000 positions be opened up for these higher classes. The protesting teachers say that even 7,500 new recruits will leave a gaping hole in classes 9–12 of Gujarat’s government and grant-in-aid schools. They point to an advertisement issued by the government, which calls for applications to fill 1,200 vacancies for principal, and 2,200 “experienced” teachers looking to switch jobs. Given that these 3,400 positions will be filled from the existing pool, and that a host of elderly teachers are set to retire on Oct 31, they feel that the current gap in teaching positions is only set to widen further. “The vacancies allotted to classes 9–12 are fewer than the number of subjects available across the schools in Gujarat. While 7,500 may seem like a lot, given the number of subjects, this comes out to less than 40 vacancies per subject,” Shaktidan Gadhvi, who has passed the TET/TAT, told Gujarat Samachar Digital. He estimates that Gujarat’s schools need closer to 15,000 new recruits. “The government should do a ground-level check, and the chief minister and education minister should discuss the issue and double the number of jobs in the higher classes. We are tired of making these frequent trips to Gandhinagar to plead our case,” he added. Also read: Protesting forest dept recruitment candidates detained by Gandhinagar police",gandhinagar
Dehgam land scam: Disputed lands transferred to government,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/dehgam-land-disputed-lands-transferred-to-government,2024-08-10,10,08,2024,"After the land scam involving the sale of village land in the Dahod’s Juna Pahadiya, the government has swung into action. Instead of cancelling the sale documents, efforts are underway for the current landowners to donate the land to the government. The land documents for Sampa’s Kalipura, Juna Pahadiya, and Ramaji are now being reviewed for a government takeover. After the cancellation of the sale record for Kalipura’s land, the sale record for Juna Pahadiya was also cancelled, and a decision will be made for Ramaji’s land in the coming days. Initially, the sale documents were made for open land instead of the land with construction. Once these cases came to light, the revenue department took action, and decisions were made in the Gandhinagar Sub-Divisional Officer’s court. Amidst these developments, the revenue department and higher officials are involved to ensure that residents do not suffer. Although the sale records were cancelled, the sale documents are still valid until officially cancelled, and current owners still hold ownership. Efforts are now underway to have the land formally transferred to the government. The process will involve transferring the land to the government via a donation deed (bakshish lekh) through the sub registrar’s office, thus making the land government property. Subsequently, the government will provide ownership rights to the current residents. On the other hand, the district administration or revenue department cannot intervene in the cancellation of sale documents. Even if the sale record is cancelled, the sale documents allow current owners to sell or transfer the land to others. Therefore, affected parties need to approach the civil court to have the sale documents annulled. Currently, the government is working to resolve these issues by transferring the land ownership to the government.

The advisory comes in the wake of the horrific rape and murder of a doctor at Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Instead of outlining specific safety measures for female doctors, the circular essentially places the onus of safety on the individuals themselves. Dr Shobhna Gupta, dean of GMERS Gandhinagar, issued the circular, advising female doctors, students, and staff to avoid going out at night and to be accompanied if necessary. The advisory also suggests that female doctors should stay in hostels with other female colleagues or acquaintances. Furthermore, female doctors have been instructed to call the women’s helpline ‘181’ in case of untoward incidents. Doctors have expressed their displeasure with this circular, arguing that it fails to address the root of the problem — the lack of adequate safety measures on campus. They contend that the dean’s instructions place the burden of safety solely on the women, without providing concrete solutions. “We may have to go out at any time during an emergency. In such situations, we have to go alone. The college administration should take steps to ensure our safety. They are trying to shirk their responsibility. The college management should tighten security throughout the campus and keep an eye on strangers,” said an aggrieved doctor.

The new measures aim to curb the misuse of leave policies and enhance accountability, ensuring that employees do not exploit the system while they continue to be on the payroll. According to sources from the State Secretariat, an order has been issued to investigate the reasons for the leaves of employees not only in the Education and Health departments but also across all government departments and offices of boards and corporations. A report has been requested to determine how many days or months an employee has been absent in each department. Employees on extended leave or those who have travelled abroad will be investigated, and actions such as issuing notices, termination, or taking disciplinary measures will be initiated against those responsible. Typically, the employees are granted earned leave, half-pay leave, converted leave, non-accumulative leave, sick leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, casual leave, and compensatory leave. If an employee wishes to travel abroad, they must submit their documents and a leave report. However, due to negligence in some departments, document verification is not conducted, resulting in employees settling abroad. The state government now intends to delegate the authority for approving leave, amend leave rules, exercise more caution in cases involving travel abroad, and fix the responsibility of the department head. Moreover, certain restrictions may be imposed on employees taking leave for serious illness, weddings, and other occasions. According to sources, the Finance Department’s order under the Gujarat Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 2002, may include new provisions.

Gujarat passes landmark Bill to curb human sacrifice and black magic,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-passes-landmark-bill-to-curb-human-sacrifice-and-black-magic,2024-08-21,21,08,2024,"The state government unanimously passed a bill to abolish the practice of black magic and tantrik activities on the first day of the Monsoon Session in the state assembly. The Gujarat Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and Other Inhuman, Evil, and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Bill, 2024 was previously tabled in 2008 and 2012, but did not go through until Aug 21. With this, Gujarat will become the seventh state to enact such a law; Maharashtra, Karnataka, Orissa, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Assam already have one in place targeting “black magic practitioners” who are variously styled as godmen, aghori babas or bhuvas . Notably, a Gujarat High Court division bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal is currently hearing a PIL (public interest litigation), which has been seeking action against unlawful tantrik activities in the state. The state has seen two people die in human sacrifices as recently as 2022, while similar rituals claimed five lives in 2020. According to the PIL, recent victims have included minor girl who was tortured to death by her father and uncle as part of an occult ritual, a farmer couple who ended their lives in a brutal act of human sacrifice, and a two-month-old baby girl who was maimed and killed by a witch doctor. Discussions in the House During discussions on the issue, BJP MLA Dr CJ Chavda, who represents Vijapur, said: “Gujarat should be preparing for a robotic revolution in the next 10 years. Instead, we are still dealing with superstition, black magic and psychological warfare among the people. These bhuvas cause people trouble and cost them both time and resources.” He underscored the importance of the legislation in protecting the people from bhuvas and tantriks . Kankrej MLA Amrutji Thakor pointed out that anyone could fall prey to bhuvas and tantriks . “For instance,” he said, “even financially well-off and educated parents lead their children towards blind faith and black magic if the latter don’t get good jobs.” Patan MLA Dr Kirit Patel concurred. “Teachers and government officials are not immune either,” he said, adding that whistleblowers should be given anonymity and protection against reprisals from such “practitioners of dark magic”. Highlighting the mention of blessings of supernatural powers in the bill, he pointed out that “talk of lighting a lamp in 2020 was like talking about ringing a thali in 2021 (during the COVID-19 pandemic)”. Adding a note of levity to the proceedings, the Congress party's deputy leader and Dani Limda MLA Shailesh Parmar sarcastically stated that a “woman corporator had performed black magic” on him, and that he wears beads to ward off the effect of her efforts. He also joked that black magic had led the two Congress MLAs who had introduced the bill to jump ship to the BJP. On a slightly more serious note, he pointed out that Asaram bapu, the self-styled godman and convicted rapist, would have been imprisoned in Ahmedabad’s Sabarmati Jail, and not a Jaipur jail. Meanwhile, Minister of State for Home, Harsh Sanghavi urged the people’s representatives to come together in unity to have the bill turned into a law. He also exhorted his colleagues to work together to convince the public to turn away from superstition. Hedging his bets, he also said that “respectable bhuvas ” would not be targeted under the new legislation since it was intended purely to protect the public from being exploited in the name of witchcraft and ghosts.

He further stated that not only the teachers who are compromising the future of students but also the responsible officers in the DEO’s office should face action. Dindor replied, “In Banaskantha district, 12 teachers from government primary schools and 7 teachers from Patan are not receiving salaries. Out of the 12 absentee teachers from Banaskantha, action has been taken against six, and they have been removed from their duties according to the rules. Two teachers have voluntarily resigned. “At a time when the online attendance of teachers is being monitored by the Vidya Samiksha Kendra, information about unauthorised absence of teachers from 2019 to 2022 was collected, and action was taken.

The Opposition leaders claimed their questions were excluded from the discussion agenda, staging a walkout from the House. Congress MLA Amit Chavda said that no questions were taken from the 12 questions provided by the Opposition. Chavda alleged that questions related to public issues were cancelled. To this, Gujarat Assembly Speaker Shankar Chaudhary reportedly replied that the Opposition’s majority is less so the questions will be taken based on that. Congress leader Shailesh Parmar alleged that MLA Gulab Singh Chauhan’s question on Dahod land was cancelled, along with 12 questions today, leaving only two questions up for debate which were from the ruling party. After the walkout, BJP’s Rushikesh Patel proposed to suspend Congress MLAs from the House, which was supported by Minister Harsh Sanghavi, leading to the suspension of the MLAs for today. Following the walk out, Amit Chavda said, “The government employees are paid with people’s money, but their questions are not being raised in the House in a process of killing democracy. To hide the mismanagement, questions related to land scams have been refused.

The Education Minister recently said that they recruited 4,000 teachers which is not true. Over 32,000 teaching positions have remained vacant in Gujarat for an extended period, leaving around 50,000 TET-TAT qualified candidates waiting for permanent appointments,” Congress leader Manish Doshi said. He alleged that in reality, the process merely involves transferring existing teachers under the guise of new recruitment, betraying the hopes of thousands of educated young men and women in the state. TET is a mandatory qualification for teaching in Classes 1 to 8, while those teaching in Classes 9 to 12 must have cleared the TAT. Doshi said that the BJP government is presenting a rosy picture through advertisements worth crores, but the reality is far from it, adding that the education sector in Gujarat is in a deplorable state. He also criticised the government for planning to merge or close down grant-aided schools under the pretext of low enrollment, a move he described as a conspiracy which would harm students from tribal communities. “We have reached an alarming situation. Many schools operate with only a single classroom, forcing students from multiple grades to share the same space,” he said. Congress also criticised the BJP’s ‘Gyan Sahayak Yojana,’ calling it an unconstitutional and illegal scheme which exploits the state’s youth economically. He emphasised that the government’s failure to appoint permanent teachers and provide adequate infrastructure has left students in over 31% of Gujarat’s government schools without basic amenities like drinking water.

The fraudster made the man believe that his phone and bank accounts were linked to anti-national activities and extorted ₹47.62 lakh from him. “The scam began when the fraudster posed as a police officer, falsely claiming that the senior citizen’s phone and bank accounts were involved in criminal activities like money laundering. The fraudster threatened the victim with arrest unless a large sum of money was paid, resulting in the extortion of ₹47.62 lakh,” police officials shared. “Upon realising he had been duped, the victim immediately contacted the State Cyber Crime Cell via the 24-hour cybercrime helpline, 1930, and filed a complaint under the AASHVAST project. Acting on this complaint, the bank accounts of the suspects were identified and frozen through the NCRP portal under BNSS Sections 94 and 106. As a result, Rs 35 lakh of the extorted amount was successfully blocked,” they said. The recovery was made possible by a special Refund Unit formed under the instructions of the Additional Director General of Police, CID & Railways, S P Rajkumar, and the Superintendents of Police Dharmendra Sharma and Bharat Tank of the Cyber Crime Cell. “We urge all citizens to report cybercrimes immediately by contacting the cybercrime helpline at 1930, visiting the website www.cybercrime.gov.in, or approaching the nearest Cybercrime Police Station to ensure prompt action,” the officials added. The blocked funds were returned to the victim following legal procedures. The Ahmedabad City Cybercrime Branch filed the necessary court order, and on July 18, the court issued an order freezing the fraudulent account. After verification and compliance with court orders, the State Cyber Crime Cell processed the refund, and on August 9, ₹35 lakh were returned to the victim.

Following this, a delegation of the protesting candidates met with Gujarat Minister of Primary, Secondary and Old-age Education Kuber Dindor. The representatives were assured by Dindor that teacher recruitment will be announced before Diwali. The government informed the delegation that the recruitment reports (RR) for new recruitments have not been released yet as the process for recruiting old teachers is currently underway. Yesterday, the protesting candidates were informed by education department officials that the RRs were still being prepared. However, today, the education minister stated that the RRs for new recruitment are ready and will be announced soon. TET-TAT candidates protest in Gandhinagar on Teachers’ Day The TET-TAT protests intensified today and were extended to Parinam Circle CH 3, led by activist Yuvrajsinh Jadeja. The aspirants held demonstrations and blocked the road leading to the Secretariat, following which they were detained by the police in front of the gate. The candidates had staged the protest demanding the immediate release of the recruitment notification for secondary school teachers as promised by the government. Furthermore, they demanded the filling of vacant teaching posts, an increase in the number of seats, and the inclusion of computer teachers in the recruitment drive. Narendra Solanki, a protesting candidate, said, “On June 19, Gujarat’s spokesperson minister Rushikesh Patel had announced that permanent teachers would be recruited within the next three months. However, more than two and a half months have passed since then, and no notification has been issued. That’s why we are here today.” Digvijaysinh Zala, another protester from Kheda, added, “We will continue our protest until the recruitment process begins. We will not leave Gandhinagar. The government had announced a phased recruitment process for both secondary and higher secondary schools, but they have failed to take any action. Many candidates have reached the age limit, and the lack of action has forced us to resort to this protest.” The protesters were referring to the state government’s previous announcement of recruiting 24,700 teachers. While the primary school recruitment process has already begun, the notification for secondary school teachers, which was expected on September 1, has been delayed.

GNLU study calls for online gaming regulations for 500 million users nationwide,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/national/gnlu-gandhinagar-online-gaming-regulations-500-million-users-in-india,2024-09-05,5,09,2024,"Online gaming A study report prepared by Gujarat National Law University (GNLU) in Gandhinagar has highlighted the urgent need for regulations in the online gaming industry in India. The report states there exist 500 million users across various online gaming platforms and apps in the country, but the industry lacks standardised regulations. The GNLU study has proposed a unified regulatory structure for the online gaming industry. The report, which was also submitted to the state government, presents various findings and recommendations to justify the need for such regulations. The study emphasises that there should be limits on how much time users spend on gaming apps and how much money they can transact. It also recommends a filtering system to identify and approve only those apps and platforms that meet certain quality standards. While some states in India have implemented their regulations for online gaming, and many other countries worldwide have similar regulations in place, the Indian online gaming industry as a whole remains largely unregulated. Madras HC ruling on online gaming The Tamil Nadu Gaming and Police Laws (Amendment) Act 2021, passed by the state government, prohibited all forms of online games (including games based on mere skills) within the state. While hearing a petition challenging this, the Madras High Court in 2021 ruled that a blanket ban falls foul of the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade, or business mentioned in the Constitution. Responding to the advocate general’s argument that online games could be susceptible to manipulation, the court remarked, “You regulate it. You can’t ban the games altogether.” However, it added that this judgment doesn’t bar the state from formulating any other legislation in this regard.",gandhinagar
Gujarat mandates Karmayogi App registration for all govt employees,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-mandates-karmayogi-app-registration-for-all-govt-employees,2024-09-05,5,09,2024,"Within a day of AAP leader Gopal Italia’s jibe at Harsh Sanghavi over an alleged goof up of the Gujarat home department, the government issued a circular mandating registration of all government officials. On Sept 3, Italia criticised  Sanghavi after he received a notification sanctioning his promotion from constable to head constable despite letting off the job in 2015. However, the Ahmedabad police clarified the matter, stating the document was part of an assessment process and not a promotion order. As per the government circular released on Sept 4, all government officials and employees must compulsorily register on the Karmyogi application, a centralised digital information of its employees. The government has directed that the registration process be completed within a month. Moreover, the heads of the concerned offices must certify the registration of their employees, failing which salaries will not be disbursed. Gopal Italia’s jibe Italia took to social media platform X, displaying a major lapse in the department’s operations. In a mocking jibe at Sanghavi, he said, “I am grateful to the Home Minister Harsh Sanghavi for promoting me to the rank of Head Constable and including my name at number 726 in this year’s Constable promotion list even though I left my job in the Gujarat Police in 2015.” Responding to these claims, Ahmedabad police posted on X, “Recently, 137 Head Constables in Ahmedabad were promoted to the rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI), and directions were issued to fill the vacancies immediately by promoting police constables to head constables.” “This list included the names of all police constables who had joined the department up to Jan 11, 2012. Since Gopal Italia joined the police force in 2012, his name was included in the list. However, no police station is mentioned against his name, which clearly indicates that Italia has not been promoted to the rank of Head Constable. The messages circulating on social media are false and baseless. It appears that Italia has not read the letter he posted properly,” read the tweet.

Officials shared on Sept 5, “The new regulations aim to safeguard both visitors and operators, ensuring that gaming zones are developed responsibly and with adequate safety provisions.” Given the increasing popularity of gaming zones as entertainment hubs across the state, CM Bhupendra Patel’s decision is a bid to ensure public safety and security in such crowded areas. The new regulations cover key aspects such as road width, minimum area, building height, parking spaces, and mandatory safety measures. Key provisions added in CGDCR: Construction requirements: Provisions have been made for road width, minimum area, building height, parking, safety measures, and various types of NOCs (No Objection Certificates) required for the construction of gaming activity areas. Safety provisions: For independent gaming activity plots, there are specific provisions for separate entry and exit points, emergency exits, and refuge areas to ensure public safety. Certifications and licences: It has been clarified that gaming zones must display a BU (Building Usage) certificate, fire NOC, and all other required licences, certificates, NOCs, and permits. Revised permissions: It has been ensured that for buildings with prior development or BU permissions, revised permissions must be obtained according to the new regulations before beginning operations. Penalties for unauthorised use: CM Patel emphasised that violators operating without proper permissions will face penalties under the updated rules. Rajkot game zone fire This decision follows the May 25 fire at Rajkot’s TRP Game Zone that claimed the lives of at least 27 people, highlighting the urgent need for stricter planning and safety regulations. The exact cause of the fire remains under investigation even months after the tragedy. The gaming zone, constructed in 2024 using temporary structures with tin roofs and two floors, lacked adequate safety measures. Reports indicate insufficient fire extinguishers and emergency exits in the facility. Moreover, the building had not received the necessary certification from the fire department, raising concerns about regulatory compliance and safety standards.

Earlier, disciplinary actions were allowed on police staff on the seizure of country liquor worth ₹15,000 and ₹25,000 worth of IMFL.

In the past three years alone, 6,529 police officers and 23,555 police personnel have faced disciplinary action in connection with raids on illegal alcohol and gambling operations. The action by the state against its own police department shows that the crux of the problem lies in the close ties between law enforcement officials and illegal operators.

The extension will connect GNLU, PDEU, GIFT City and Gandhinagar’s Sector-1, significantly improving urban mobility between the two cities. The 33.5 km journey from APMC (Vasna) to Gandhinagar Sector-1 will cost ₹35 and take 65 minutes, offering a much cheaper alternative to taxi or auto-rickshaw rides, which can cost over ₹375 for the same distance. The metro train will operate from Motera Stadium station to Sector-1 metro station in Gandhinagar from 8 am to 6.35 pm, and from Sector-1 metro station to Motera Stadium metro station from 7.20 am to 7.20 pm. The Phase 2 extension will cover a 21 km stretch from Motera to Gandhinagar, with a separate corridor reaching GIFT City, enhancing connectivity for residents, professionals, and students. The key features of Metro Phase 2 include: The second phase of the Metro rail will serve eight stations across Gandhinagar, including key locations like GNLU, PDEU, GIFT City, and Infocity. Metro services will significantly reduce commute times, making it possible to travel from Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar within an hour. Introducing the Metro Phase 2 is expected to have a transformative impact on the local economy. The ease of access to commercial hubs like GIFT City and Infocity will lead to higher productivity and stimulate growth in real estate around the new Metro stations.

CID Crime to investigate the Swaminarayan Sansthan land scams,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/cid-crime-to-investigate-the-swaminarayan-sansthan-land-scams,2024-09-16,16,09,2024,"Considering the scale of land scams, the Gujarat Home department has decided to transfer all cases involving the Swaminarayan Sansthan’s name to the CID Crime. Scammers involved in crimes under the guise of Swaminarayan temples and cow shelters are active in Ahmedabad, Anand, Nadiad, Surat, Rajkot, Sabarkantha, and Wadhwan, according to reports. They allegedly purchase lands for the construction of temples, cow shelters, and other buildings under the name of the Swaminarayan sect. They deceive farmers by offering to buy land at high prices, promising to sell it to a Swaminarayan priest at an even higher price, and securing land deals under false pretenses. Several crimes related to this scam have been reported, prompting the Home department to transfer the investigation from local police to the CID Crime Branch. Modus operandi The ‘gang’ targets brokers involved in land trading, showing them valuable land in certain villages or areas. They claim that the Swaminarayan sect wants to purchase this land for religious institutions and cow shelters. Since Swaminarayan priests cannot directly buy land from farmers, they convince these individuals that they would make a large profit by purchasing the land themselves and selling it to the sect. After securing the sale agreements, they even brought along a saint to inspect the land, further solidifying the trust of the buyers, who then paid farmers crores of rupees for the land. However, the gang would later claim that the farmers were unwilling to sell the land, thus defrauding the brokers that involved both the farmers and Swaminarayan saints.

Gujarat sees significant rise in country’s GDP share in last 2 decades: EAC-PM paper,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/business/gujarat-sees-significant-rise-in-countrys-gdp-share-in-last-2-decades-eac-pm-paper,2024-09-17,17,09,2024,"Gujarat GDP contribution Gujarat has seen a significant increase in its share in India’s GDP in the last two decades, while consistently performing well throughout the study period from 1960-61, a paper by the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said today. The state’s share had increased from 5.8% in 1960-61 to 6.7% in 1970-71. It, however, then remained at broadly the same levels until 2000-01, before beginning to increase rapidly. “Its share rose to 8.1% in 2022-23. It is interesting to note here that Gujarat and Maharashtra were part of the same Bombay state until 1960. While Maharashtra has been able to maintain its share in India’s growing economy, Gujarat’s share was broadly flat until 2000-01 before it took off,” the EAC-PM paper said. Gujarat’s share remained at broadly the same levels until 2000-01, before beginning to increase rapidly - from 6.4% in 2000-01 to 8.1% in 2022-23. By 2023-24, Gujarat’s per capita income rose to 160.7% of the national average, from 118.3% in 1960-61. Initially, Gujarat lagged Maharashtra, with a relative per capita income of 118.3% compared to Maharashtra’s 133.7% in 1960-61. This disparity persisted until 2010-11, when it surpassed Maharashtra. By 2023-24, Gujarat’s per capita income has risen to 160.7% of the national average, as compared to 150% for Maharashtra, according to the paper. It noted that Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, and Haryana have shown steady performance, while West Bengal experienced persistent relative decline. “The western and southern regions of India have performed notably better than other parts of the country. Maharashtra and Gujarat have consistently demonstrated strong economic performance over the years,” the paper noted. The paper focused exclusively on the relative performance of states, measured using two indicators - share in India’s GDP and relative per capita income. The state’s share in India’s GDP is calculated by dividing the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of the state by the sum of GSDP of all states. Relative per capita income is calculated as the ratio of the per capita Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) of the state as a percentage of the all-India per capita Net National Product (or Net National Income in some years).

Infocity police have filed a complaint under section 115-2, 352, 351 and 54 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) against the three. Police have launched an investigation. However, this is not Chaubey’s first brush with being on the wrong side of the law. He was among several officials acquitted in what came to be known as the Sohrabbuddin ‘fake encounter’ case. According to the First Incident Report (FIR) filed by a Randesan resident Hemangbhai Ashokbhai Patel, on the evening of September 16, the DySP’s younger son and one of his friends had left the lift open while going up to Chaubey’s home on the fifth floor. When Patel asked the youngsters to close the lift doors, the youngest Chaubey allegedly started a fight. The incident escalated when the boy came down in the same lift, and hurled more abuses at Patel, who was still waiting to use it. Soon, Balakrishna Chaubey and his older son also joined the fray, and the assault turned physical, Patel told the police. “They (the three Chaubeys) started hitting me with a stick, until my younger brother Ankitbhai intervened. Then they said, ‘You know us. We will implicate you in a wrong case’, and threatened to kill me if I stepped foot in the society again,”  he said.

According to the teachers, while administrative staff with a graduate degree are set to receive ₹49,600, teachers with higher qualifications like NET, SLET, and PhDs will only be paid ₹41,000. Teachers are demanding a fairer and more equitable pay scale for all education sector employees. The government has increased the pay of junior to senior level clerks and other administrative staff in grant-aid colleges by ₹16,224 to ₹21,100, ₹19,950 to ₹26,000, ₹31,340 to ₹40,800, and ₹38,090 to ₹49,600. While administrative staff have received a significant pay increase, assistant teachers have only received a small raise. Moreover, on July 1, 2024, the government allowed a 30% salary raise to assistant teachers of more than 300 grant-aid colleges. However, the resolution of the salary increase issued on September 13 provides that the salary increase will be implemented from the date of the announcement. On the other hand,  Class 3 and Class 4 administrative staff on fixed salaries are slated to receive arrears for 9 months. The Teachers’ Association has also raised this issue but has not received any response from the government. The association’s president has stated that both teachers and administrative staff are being treated unfairly and has demanded that the government address this issue seriously.

The petition calls for an increase in vacancies for the special Forest Beat Guard exam recruitment and the abolition of the ComputerBased Recruitment Test (CBRT) system. In August, Gandhinagar saw a week-long agitation by aspirants who failed to clinch one of 823 vacancies for forest beat guards. They cited issues with the language of the test, technical glitches, variations in difficulty levels and the method used to process scores as flaws in the system. They called for the CBRT to be abolished and for their marks to be published. Now, their elected representatives from across the political spectrum have banded together to take up their cause. The petition submits that many students feel the CBRT system has caused injustice to forest candidates. It criticises the normalisation system in CBRT exams for potentially lowering high-scoring candidates' marks while increasing low-scoring candidates’ marks. The politicians have requested an increase in recruitment vacancies and that all candidates' marks be published in PDF format The signatories include: BJP MLAs: Pradyumansinh Jadeja (Abdasa) Kanchanben Radadiya (Thakkarbapa Nagar) Karshan Solanki (Kadi) Kalpesh Parmar (Matar) Mukesh Patel (Olpad) Sejal Pandya (Bhavnagar East) JV Kakadiya (Dhari) Ambarish Der (Rajula, Formerly Congress) Malti Maheshwari (Gandhidham) Pravin Ghoghari (Karanj) Keshubhai Patel (Bhuj) Aniruddha Dave (Mandvi) Kirit “KK” Patel (Unjha) Pravinkumar Mali (Deesa) Virendrasinh Jadeja (Rapar) Ganpatsinh Vasava (Mangrol) Dr Jairam Gamit (Nizar) Laxmanji Thakor (Kalol-Gandhinagar) Mahesh Kaswala (Savarkundla) Balrajsinh Chauhan (Dahegam) Hardik Patel (Viramgam) Arjunsinh Chauhan (Mehmedabad) Mukesh Patel (Mehsana) Arvind Ladani (Manavadar) Amrut Thakor (Kankrej) Ritaben Patel (Gandhinagar North) Sanjaysinh Mahida (Mahudha) Aam Aadmi Party MLAs: Hemant Khava (Jamjodhpur) Chaitar Vasava (Dediapada) Congress MLAs: Dr Tushar Chaudhary (Khedbrahma) Jignesh Mevani (Vadgam) Anant Patel (Bansda) Independent MLA: Dhavalsinh Jhala (Bayad) BJP MPs: Jashubhai Rathwa Shobnaben Baraiya Congress MP: Geniben Thakor This united front of politicians from different parties highlights the significance of the issue and puts pressure on the Gujarat government to address the concerns raised about the Forest Beat Guard exam How Normalisation works For instance, five candidates score 70, 80, 90, 85, and 75, respectively. The mean, or average, in this case is 80. So Candidate A, with 70 points, is -10 points away from the average. Candidate C is +10 points away from the average; Candidates D and E are +5 and -5 away from the mean, respectively. So the typical difference, or standard deviation, is + or - 7.5 points from the mean score of 80. To get the normalised score, one subtracts the average score and divides the result by the standard deviation. So the normalised score for the candidate with 90 points would be +1.33, while it would be -1.33 for the candidate with 70 points.",gandhinagar

Following the introduction of the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) ID for higher education students last year, this year, the process has begun to create an APAAR (Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry) ID for school students. Under this initiative, the Union Ministry of Education has instructed the Commissionerate Of Schools in Gujarat to create APAAR IDs for all students from grades 9 to 12 in all secondary and higher secondary schools under the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSEB). According to the Commissionerate Of Schools 2022 statistical report, there is a total enrollment of 28 lakh students across various grades in government, aided, and private schools under the GSEB from grades 9 to 12. Now, these students will receive APAAR IDs. The APAAR ID is part of the ‘One Nation, One Student’ initiative by the Ministry of Education, designed to maintain digital records. APAAR IDs to be linked with DigiLocker The APAAR ID of students in grades 9 to 12 will be linked with DigiLocker and, in the future, with the ABC for higher education. This APAAR ID will stay with the student for a lifetime and will help them access educational resources. It will also serve as a gateway to access DigiLocker. With this ID, students will be able to digitally store and access their results, comprehensive assessment report cards, Olympiad achievements, sports awards, skill training records, and various other credentials. Students can use this credit score for higher education and employment. Furthermore, the system will help reduce dropout rates and make it possible to track out-of-school children. The objective of APAAR is ‘One Nation, One Student ID’. APAAR has been conceptualised under the NEP 2020 in which all college/university-going students are required to register on ABC, i.e., ABC. According to the new rule, it is necessary to have an ABC ID to be admitted to any college or university. Also read: Academic Bank of Credits: Only 106 educational institutes registered",gandhinagar

The results, announced by the Gujarat Public Service Commission (GPSC) on September 19 have reportedly led to dissatisfaction among candidates, particularly those from reserved categories, the Congress leaders alleged. According to the Congress, many deserving candidates from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC), and even the general (OPEN) category have been unable to qualify for the CCE Main Exam due to issues related to cutoff marks and merit list errors. The party pointed out that GPSC had previously offered category-wise relaxations for similar exams, such as Class 1/2 and Class 3 level exams. However, many candidates were deprived of these relaxations this time, causing significant distress. In the letter to the CM, the Congress party emphasized that the newly applied standards had led to unfair treatment of backward category candidates. The party expressed concern over the systemic oversight and demanded a review of the merit list and cutoffs to ensure fairness in the selection process. The Congress further stated that this issue has created unnecessary challenges for candidates from disadvantaged backgrounds. The letter concluded with an appeal to the Gujarat government to take swift action and ensure that the GPSC rectifies the situation, safeguarding the rights of all affected candidates. On September 21, Congress urged the CM to increase the number of vacancies for Secondary and Higher Secondary Teaching Assistants and extend the age limit for TET-1 and TET-2 qualified candidates. Congress spokesperson Dr. Manish Doshi claimed that the government’s announcement of 7,500 vacancies was insufficient, as over 38,000 candidates have already passed the TET exams in Gujarat, many of whom are nearing the upper age limit. Congress claimed that this delay in recruitment has put thousands of eligible candidates at risk of missing their opportunity. “If 15,000 vacancies are announced instead of the current 7,500, it would ensure justice for most qualified candidates,” said Dr. Doshi. He further called for simultaneous recruitment announcements for government and grant-in-aid schools to help alleviate the teacher shortage in Gujarat’s schools.

Rajnikant Bhartiya, president of the Gujarat Pharmacists Association, stated that every district office of the FDCA has become a hub of corruption. He alleged that officials are issuing medical store licenses in exchange for bribes, enabling individuals to sell drugs used for narcotics and abortions, while also peddling counterfeit medicines, jeopardising the health of over 6.5 crore people in Gujarat. Despite recent arrests of two drug inspectors in Ahmedabad for accepting bribes, the corruption appears to persist, with drug inspectors still collecting fees from medical stores without fear of repercussions.

The Ponzi scheme was being run out of a call centre at Santej in Gandhinagar, officials said. The scammers, described by the police as  well-trained youth above 18 years of age, targeted potential investors across India with promises of lucrative stock market returns. They would initially show small profits to gain trust before persuading investors to commit larger sums, ultimately building up to substantial amounts. One victim reportedly lost ₹55 lakh to the scheme. The investigation took Gandhinagar Range DIG Virendrasinh Yadav and his team of about 50 police officers to multiple locations across Gandhinagar and Mehsana districts, including Vadnagar, Visnagar, Kheralu, and Satlasana. The investigation began with 12 complaints, the first of which was filed in Vadnagar’s Smart police station. This led to FIRs against a total of 19 accused. Five of these were arrested, produced in a court and remanded to police custody. The rest were marked as absconders. Then, on September 26, a raid at the call centre in Santej resulted in the apprehension of 24 more suspects, including 14 who had been evading the police. In all, the police have now registered five cases of financial fraud against the 29 accused. Investigators are now looking into the bank accounts through which the ₹27 crore was funnelled as part of the scheme. The case highlights the growing issue of cybercrime and financial fraud in the region, and serves as a stark reminder to potential investors about the importance of verifying the legitimacy of financial opportunities.",gandhinagar
Reality check behind Gujarat's skyrocketing tourism: 94% of tourists were from state,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/locals-more-than-others-inflated-tourist-numbers-in-gujarat-a-smoke-screen,2024-09-27,27,09,2024,"As the world celebrates Tourism Day today (September 27), the government’s published tourist figures appear to diverge from reality. Tourism spots in Gujarat lack basic amenities and fail to attract both foreign and out-of-state visitors. Despite this, the government boasts about inflated statistics, showing a high number of local tourists who visit in the morning and return by evening. Tourists who encounter a lack of amenities have a bad experience and do not return to the tourist spots in Gujarat. The government claims that 18.59 crore tourists visited in 2023-24, but over 94% of these were local or residents of the state. In districts where tourism sites are located, government circuit houses have been built. These are primarily used by politicians and babus, so private tourists often do not have access to them. As the rates for private accommodations at circuit houses are not affordable, people prefer staying in private hotels. Increase in visitors but decrease in amenities The government acknowledges that 17.50 crore local tourists visited over the year, while the number of foreign tourists was only 23 lakh. Although the corporation claims a 24% increase in tourists over a year, it does not provide data on the decline in amenities. Key tourist sites lack facilities such as vehicle parking, clean water, electricity, transportation, guides, and sufficient hotel and restaurant options. Due to a lack of amenities, the number of tourists visiting Gujarat’s only hill station, Saputara, has decreased to just 11 lakh in a year. For UNESCO-listed sites, the lack of basic facilities means that tourists struggle to find accommodation or meals. Beach tourism in the state is also in decline, and the Dinosaur Park in Balasinor lacks any accommodation arrangements. The only exception is Sasan Gir, where a significant number of tourists visit to see lions each year. 25% of tourists visit pilgrimage sites Regarding religious tourism, the highest number of visitors over the year includes 16.5 crore at Ambaji, 97.93 lakh at Somnath, 83.54 lakh at Dwarka, 76.66 lakh at Pavagadh, and 34.22 lakh at Dakor. In total, the tourism department has counted 4.57 crore devotees, which is a figure the pilgrimage development board could rightfully claim. Misleading statistics The statistics provided by the Gujarat Tourism Corporation seem deceptive because, in one year, the number of tourists skyrocketed from 2.67 crore to 14.98 crore. Excluding the pandemic, the average number of tourists in the state has consistently remained around 5-6 crore. Tourism in Guj in past five years Year Tourist Arrivals 2019 5.78 crore 2020 6.09 crore 2021 1.18 crore 2022 2.67 crore 2023 14.98 crore Also read: Gujarat govt allocates over ₹850 cr to develop secondary pilgrimage sites",gandhinagar

Most commonly, bribes were accepted to passively turn a blind eye to various offences, including: Wandering livestock Betting on sports such as cricket Off-the-books sales of highly controlled biofuel Activities deemed illegal under prohibition Smuggling of wood and stone Vehicles carrying cattle to the abottoir Bribe money also paid for corrupt police personnel to take an active role to lessen criminal charges, or leave names out of cases, and release impounded vehicles. Dirty cops also accepted pay-offs to help complainants file applications and for accused to apply for bail. These findings cast doubt on Gujarat’s anti-corruption efforts and highlight a pervasive stain on the khaki uniform. However, the issue of corruption has long plagued the home department, of which the police are a part. For instance, In 2019, corruption in the home department was valued at ₹37 lakh, a considerable increase from ₹20 lakh in 2018 and ₹5 lakh in 2017. For all its “May I help you?” messaging, perhaps it is time for the Gujarat police to look inwards and help bridge the gap between the government’s claims and the reality on the ground.

Forest and Environment Minister Mulu Bera announced the findings and spoke on Gujarat’s role as a “paradise” for bird conservation, with an impressive variety of local and migratory species. The report’s release coincides with India’s preparations for Wildlife Conservation Week, which will be celebrated from October 2 to 8. This week highlights Gujarat’s ongoing efforts in wildlife protection and conservation. Several state initiatives, including the ‘Karuna Campaign’ and mobile veterinary services, have been launched to ensure the care and well-being of birds and other wildlife. Key findings of the report include the discovery that Devbhumi Dwarka has the highest bird diversity, recording 456 species, while Kutch saw over 4.56 lakh birds from 161 species. Nal Sarovar emerged as a critical bird hotspot, with more than 3.62 lakh birds, further emphasising Gujarat’s significant role in bird conservation. Other important areas include Jamnagar, Ahmedabad, and Banaskantha, all contributing substantially to the state's bird population. Minister Bera praised Gujarat’s diverse ecosystems, attracting bird enthusiasts from India and abroad. “From the stunning Rann of Kutch to the lush landscapes of Gir National Park, Gujarat’s habitats serve as sanctuaries for birds, including the thousands of Greater Flamingos that paint the white desert pink during migration,” Bera said. These ecosystems provide year-round shelter and food for local and migratory birds, further solidifying Gujarat’s reputation as a bird conservation hub. The report also highlighted the importance of Jamnagar, Kutch, and Ahmedabad as vital bird conservation regions. Wetlands such as Nal Sarovar and Khijadiya Bird Sanctuary play essential roles in supporting bird populations. Nal Sarovar hosts 3.62 lakh birds, making it one of Gujarat’s most critical bird conservation sites. The bird survey was conducted in collaboration with the eBird platform, documenting more than 300 bird species based on data from 398 eBird checklists. This extensive survey included contributions from NGOs, universities, and ornithologists, ensuring thorough data collection across Gujarat’s regions and wetlands. The report provides detailed data on bird populations across Gujarat’s districts. For instance, Kutch recorded 161 bird species with a total population of 4,56,881 birds, while Jamnagar had 221 species and 4,11,552 birds. Ahmedabad contributed significantly, with 256 bird species and 3,65,134 birds.

Candidates convened in Gandhinagar today threatened mass protests if their demands were not met. The CCE Junior Clerk aspirants have demanded the complete abolition of the Computer Based Recruitment Test (CBRT) method in competitive exams. They have also urged that the upcoming main exam be conducted offline and as a single-paper examination. Last month, the candidates submitted a written application to Police Recruitment Board chief IPS Hasmukh Patel, demanding the abolition of the CBRT method and the declaration of CCE exam marks as per the GPSC (Gujarat Public Service Commission) pattern. Furthermore, the candidates have also conveyed their concerns to IAS Kamal Dayani of the General Administration Department (GAD). One of the key grievances raised by the candidates is the inconsistencies found in the merit list for the junior clerk exam. The exam notification called for candidates seven times the number of vacancies (5,500) for Group A and Group B exams, resulting in a very high cut-off. Consequently, candidates are now demanding that the main examination should be conducted offline.

Gujarat ministers taken aback after their chat on BJP recruitment drive goes viral,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-ministers-gossip-on-bjp-recruitment-drive-goes-viral,2024-10-08,8,10,2024,"What if a tête-à-tête with your friend were recorded and went viral on social media? This is exactly what happened to Gujarat Health Minister Rushikesh Patel and Jagdish Vishwakarma, whose portfolios include Protocol (Independent Charge). They were chatting about the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ‘Sadasyata Abhiyan 2024’ (National Membership Drive) during a press conference on October 6, without realising how close they were to cameras. A video clip of their conversation, with audio intact, has blown up on social media. In the conversation that was accidentally caught on camera, Patel is heard reacting to a comment by Vishwakarma on the targets of the membership drive with “Je thaay ae, kaadhi mele to kaadhi mele” (Let’s see what happens, if they remove us, let it be.) The Sadasyata Abhiyan was launched on September 2 to expand BJP’s membership and reinforce its organisational structure ahead of several upcoming elections. From the horse’s mouth Here’s a roughly translated version of the snippet that was caught on camera: Vishwakarma: “Party... PM (Narendra Modi) sir has asked for a report. How many votes did you get? How many members did you create? It’s confirmed news. How many voters do you have and what percentage did you achieve?” Rushikesh Patel: “What will this prove? Will it prove performance?” Vishwakarma: “No, the party checks it all over differently.” Patel: “Whatever happens, let it happen…” Vishwakarma: “I’m not saying that. I’m saying the party is doing its whole analysis.” Panchal: “Most of the assembly seats have reached 45-50%.” Patel: “I have reached 50-55%.” Vishwakarma: “Of the votes you got?” Rushikesh Patel: “I got 90,000 votes and created 50,000 members.” This inadvertent recording serves as a reminder of the thin line between political strategy and public scrutiny in the age of social media.

The questions on acquirement of the land was raised as the land in question was not inherited. In a written complaint, it was alleged that in 2017, the agricultural land was assumed in the names of Punambhai Kalabhai, Hiteshbhai Kantilal, and Ramanbhai Ishwarbhai. Surprisingly, the document lacked last names. The last name of the MLA, ‘Vora’ was not mentioned anywhere in the document till 2016.

While IAS officers generally allow visitors to keep their phones in their offices, some IPS officers require them to surrender their devices, citing concerns over unauthorised audio and video recordings of sensitive information. The survey, conducted a day after the confrontation between Congress MLA Jignesh Mevani and Additional Director-General of Police (ADG) Rajkumar Pandian, sought responses from five IAS collectors and five IPS District Superintendents of Police (SPs). The argument between Mevani and ADG Pandian at the Gandhinagar Police Bhavan on October 15 occurred when Pandian asked Mevani and a colleague to leave their phones outside during a meeting to discuss concerns of the Dalit community. All five collectors stated they do not require visitors to leave their phones outside, emphasising their commitment to transparency and accessibility. One collector noted, “We are government officials. Even if a visitor records in our office, we allow it. We even answer calls at 2 am for electricity issues.” However, there was no such uniformity among the police brass. Some IPS officers expressed caution about potential misuse of recordings. SP explained, ""We ask for phones to be left outside to prevent the spread of misinformation or recordings of sensitive information, especially regarding serious incidents."" Another SP clarified that while there’s no strict rule, they occasionally request phones to be left outside, depending on the situation. SD Sharma, Joint Secretary of the Central government's Personnel and Training Department, clarified that there is no Central government directive or order regarding phone policies in government offices. He stated that IAS and IPS officers, appointed by the Central government but serving in state governments, can adjust visitor protocols according to local needs.

FDCA Commissioner HG Koshiya told Gujarat Samachar Digital that samples of the seized items would be tested within 14 days, and appropriate action taken thereafter. This timeline raises questions on the drive’s efficacy. According to Koshiya, the 15-day drive was supposedly meant to ensure food safety and raise public awareness ahead of the festive season, when more people eat out. The food samples were collected as part of extensive sampling and inspections at party plots and mandals during Navratri. This means that untested “suspicious” food was available to the public, at a time when people — especially youngsters — dine out more than ever. By the time the results come out — just before Diwali — most shoppers would have already finished buying their ingredients and preparing their snacks and sweets. A for effort? The FDCA reached 8.5 lakh people in 1,400 programmes using its mobile unit, ‘Food Safety on Wheels’. It held programmes in about 200 schools and trained 16,000 traders through 1,000 sessions. The Food Safety Fortnight also included enforcement drives, awareness campaigns, training sessions, and licence/registration camps to ensure the availability of clean and safe food items. As much as 226 tonnes of suspicious food were confiscated in 115 raids across the state. In Nadiad, for instance, the FDCA seized 2,600 kg of adulterated black pepper worth more than ₹9 lakh from one Jai Ambe Spices. Additionally, 8,728 kg of unhealthy food valued at approximately ₹13.7 lakh was destroyed to protect public health. Officials collected 8,246 samples: 2,603 enforcement samples and 5,643 surveillance samples. Yet, it is fairly safe to assume that despite the FDCA’s efforts, at least some unscrupulous vendors would have fallen through the cracks, leading to the question: Was this drive really “ahead” of the festive season?",gandhinagar

In addition to rape, Parmar has also been charged under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The move comes after the Gujarat High Court cracked down the state government for not filing the FIR despite “multiple representations”. The Dalit victim, who runs an NGO, has been sent for medical examination, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police SM Chaudhary of Gandhinagar Police. According to the FIR, the woman told the police that she and Parmar were acquainted when he called her to his residence in the MLA Quarters in Gandhinagar’s Sector 21 on July 30, 2020. He reportedly told her that he was in love with her and, while admitting that he was married, said, “I will keep you with me forever and fulfill all your duties and responsibilities.” Parmar then plied her with ice cream and water, and coerced her into intercourse. Soon after, he broke off all contact with her, she reportedly told the police, the FIR states.. The police had previously given a clean chit to the MLA, without registering an FIR. When questioned by the Gujarat High Court, the state’s counsel told the court that the woman had “wavered” in her statements, and initially filed her complaint “eight months after the alleged incident”. Counsel added that the police had not been remiss in their duty. According to the FIR filed on October 19, Parmar attempted to intimidate her into silence. “One day, (Parmar) called me on WhatsApp and threatened me, saying, ‘If you tell anyone about this, my men will kidnap you and keep you locked up.’ He also threatened to implicate me in a “wrong case” to harass me,” the woman told the police. He allegedly also boasted of his political clout and said, “I have a lot of respect. No one can spoil me,” the woman asserted in the FIR. Prior to the HC’s intervention, the woman — who has a minor daughter — reportedly attempted suicide at Rajasthan’s Jodhpur court premises on December 16, 2023.

In an official release, the Gujarat government stated that it has submitted a proposal before the commission to consider “fiscal prudence as an important factor in allocating funds among states”. States like Gujarat, which have maintained such figures, should be “rewarded”, the statement says. On a two-day visit to the state, Panagariya and four other members of the commission chaired a meeting with Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and Chief Secretary Raj Kumar among other senior officials on Monday. Addressing the media, Panagariya stated that the commission could recommend an increase from 43% to 45% in the divisible pool. However, he adds, the final decision to sanction the proposal rests with the central government. As per the recommendation of the 15th Finance Commission, 41% of the gross tax revenue currently goes to the states. Acknowledging the state’s economic robustness, Pangariya said that Gujarat has maintained a growth rate of 8.5% in the last 10 years against the country’s average real GDP growth rate of 6%. The memorandum submitted by the state government also urges the commission to address several issues, including increasing urbanisation, the multidimensional poverty index (MPI), the contribution to national GDP, the importance of sustainable development, and fiscal prudence. Gujarat is the ninth state in the roster where the five-member panel have visited. Tasked to finalise its report on such recommendations made by the states by October 2025, the commission will devise a report for a five-year tenure starting from April 1, 2026.",gandhinagar

Initiating a helmet drive, the traffic police stood at the entrance of government offices including Sachivalay on Monday where they found several officials violating traffic rules.

However, the farmer leaders have claimed that for a loss of over ₹1 lakh crore, ₹1,420 crore is a ‘joke’ for them. The farmers in Gujarat along with the Congress had demanded that the government announce a ‘green drought’ on Monday. A Congress leader told the media that if a state witnesses more than 140% of rainfall in a season, the government has to declare a green drought. The Opposition has accused the government of purposefully not announcing green drought to avoid hefty relief to farmers. Each farmer will get a meagre amount of₹15,000-₹20,000 for loss amounting to lakhs, as per the farmers' union. The farmers claimed that many farmers who suffered losses did not even receive an earlier relief package of ₹350 crore declared in July this year. From the relief money of ₹44,000, around ₹22,000 were deducted. Also read: Gujarat govt announces ₹1,419 crore relief package for farmers",gandhinagar
Gujarat HC rejects former Gandhinagar collector S K Langa’s interim bail plea,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-high-court-rejects-former-gandhinagar-collector-s-k-langa-interim-bail-plea,2024-10-25,25,10,2024,"S K Langa Incarcerated former Gandhinagar collector IAS S K Langa was denied interim bail by the Gujarat High Court on Thursday. Langa moved a bail plea on the grounds of processing a pensioner life certificate and pleaded that his family members would require his assistance in this. Langa was arrested in July last year over corruption charges regarding the 2,200 bighas (880 acres) of the land meant for sheltering cows (panjrapol) in Mulasana, near Ahmedabad. In this case, the prosecution argued, “A pensioner life certificate processing cannot be sustained as grounds for granting bail. This process can also be carried out from within the jail. The accused is jailed over serious charges, and considering their gravity, the interim bail cannot be granted to him at this stage.” Langa resorted to withdrawing his application after Guj HC Justice Hasmukh D Suthar’s tough stance against his bail plea. In a deep-rooted scam dating back to 1918, the land in Mulasana, given as a charity for the cow grazing on a 99-year leasehold, was bought by the scammers and the bogus documents were made for the same land by the officials and so-called leaders. This piece of agricultural land was granted the label of being ‘NA’ (non-agricultural) by the then Gandhinagar collector S K Langa. During his time as Collector till 2019, Langa misused his powers, and conducted a suo motu revision of Section 211 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879, to accommodate the corrupt beneficiaries. The HC accepted the arguments made by the prosecution and dismissed the bail application.

Soon after the Diwali vacation concludes, schools across Gujarat prepare for picnic trips as part of the academic year. However, in view of the Harni boat capsize incident earlier this year, where 12 students and two teachers died by drowning during boating, picnics were prohibited for the schools. After 10 months of the tragedy, the government has issued guidelines for school educational trips, mandatory for the schools to follow. Important points from guidelines: A committee led by the principal must be formed, with parents’ representatives to include them in decisions regarding logistics, routes, risks, and benefits. For picnics within Gujarat, schools will need written permission from the District Education Officer (DEO), District Primary Education Officer (DPEO), or administrative officer for travel within the state. If the picnic is outside the state, schools will need permission from the Commissioner of Schools (for Class 9-12) or Director of Primary Education (for Class 1-8). In case of foreign trips, schools will need to inform the Education Department 15 days in advance with all details for foreign travel. Notify the local police station and Regional Transport Office, 15 days before the trip. Appoint an experienced person to oversee the trip management. Obtain written consent from the parents. Make the trip ‘optional’ and avoid forcing students or parents. Do not allow sick students to participate. At least 1 teacher for every 15 students on the trip and a female staff member for female students should be appointed. Ensure the tour vehicle has a GPS tracking system for safety. Avoid activities in water bodies. If boating is unavoidable, strictly adhere to boat capacity and provide life jackets for all participants. Maintain transparent financial records of the trip. Choose a destination after checking government weather updates. Follow RTO permit rules, and adhere to the passenger number limit in trip vehicle. Have fire safety equipment in the vehicle; train staff, students, and drivers to use it. Students, staff, or drivers must not carry or consume intoxicants or any prohibited materials. Following the release of the guidelines, numerous reactions emerged, with schools raising questions over the time it took to finalise and issue these guidelines. The penalties or actions against the school management for not following the guidelines have not yet been cleared.

Dr Manish Doshi, spokesperson at Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) has accused that the state transport corporation is witnessing a shortage of bus drivers and other staff while they are continuing to deploy over 2,800 buses in the last 1.5 years. Moreover, keeping recruitment aside, the ST corporation has started the process of appointing retired drivers and conductors on a contractual basis, alleged the opposition. On the one hand, lakhs of candidates with the qualification of driver-conductor are waiting to get a job, while on the other hand, GSRTC has not been carrying out the recruitment process for four years. After a driver crosses the age of 58, their eyesight weakens and their physical efficiency also decreases. It is difficult to drive an ST bus at this age. Thus, GSRTC itself is endangering the lives of bus passengers by employing retired drivers. If a bus accident occurs, who will be responsible?, as per Opposition’s statement. In 2023, the GSRTC announced recruitment for drivers and conductors. As a result, 1.5 lakh candidates applied for the conductor position, while 80,000 applied for the driver position. Drivers and conductors are essential for the operation of ST buses. Due to a shortage of drivers and conductors, bus operations are being disrupted, causing inconvenience to bus passengers.

A suspicious case from a hospital in Gandhinagar has turned out to be positive, marking a second suspected case of the virus. The samples from the patient in Gandhinagar were sent to laboratories in Pune, and they came out positive today. What is Zika virus? Zika virus spreads mostly by the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito, which bites during the day. The virus can be passed from a pregnant woman to her foetus and can cause infants to be born with microcephaly and other congenital malformations. It is also associated with other complications of pregnancy including preterm birth and miscarriage, individuals infected with the Zika virus can also transmit the disease to their sex partners. Most of them do not develop symptoms or are very mild. No specific treatment or vaccine is available as mostly it is self-limiting. How to prevent mosquito-borne diseases? Don't allow water to remain stagnant in and around your house. Clean the blocked drains. Empty room air coolers and flower vases completely at least once in seven days and then refill them. The tray below the fridge is also to be cleaned. Keep the water tanks and water containers tightly covered so that the mosquitoes cannot enter them and start breeding. Spraying of DDT, Malathion and Pyrethrum etc. over all the walls of the house. Use insecticidal sprays in all areas within the house at least once a week.

The residents allege that 20–25 aspirants to competitive exams — both boys and girls — are cramming into PG homes spanning just 90 square meters. This has led to issues like excessive vehicle parking, constant movement of food delivery personnel, and persistent water shortages as the PG tenants install motors to draw water for five hours a day. “The 24-hour movement of people living in the PGs causes noise and disturbances even at night,” the residents stated in their complaint. They argue that PG operations, which are a means of economic gain, should be restricted to commercial areas rather than residential neighborhoods. “If such activity is not stopped, it will encourage unethical practices,” the residents warned, requesting the authorities for an immediate closure of these PG accommodations. The representation was addressed to Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, Minister of State for Home Affairs Harsh Sanghvi, the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation, and the District Police chief. Currently, thousands of students flock to Gandhinagar to prepare for competitive exams, many of whom reside in unregistered PG accommodations in Sectors  2, 7, 8, 21 and 27. This has made it difficult for the police to track information about the students' origins and living arrangements. Adding to the confusion is the fact that several “coaching classes” where these students have enrolled to prepare for competitive exams are also unregistered. For now, the CMO has directed the Gandhinagar District Deputy Superintendent of Police to take necessary action as per rules.  What this action will be, however, is open as yet unclear and open to debate.",gandhinagar

However, this is not the first such scam the hospital is involved in. Multiple unethical practices of Khyati hospital have been reported earlier. Two years ago, using the same modus operandi, the hospital reportedly conducted a free camp in Shertha village of Gandhinagar district, where angioplasty procedures were performed on nearly nine patients in a dubious manner. Earlier unethical practices On November 26, 2022, the hospital organised a free camp at Shertha. According to Jatin Patel, a resident, 17 people, including his father, were taken by bus to Ahmedabad’s Khyati hospital. His father underwent angioplasty, but even after placing a stent, he continued to experience chest pain. His condition worsened, and he passed away during treatment at Gandhinagar Civil Hospital. One shocking revelation was that patients without Ayushman cards were sent home without treatment. Suspicious of the hospital’s medical practices, four patients outrightly refused treatment and left. Despite this, the hospital performed angioplasty and placed stent on nine patients. Residents of Shertha allege that families were not informed about the procedures and only signatures were obtained for consent. Normally, patients undergoing angioplasty are kept under observation for 24 hours, but Khyati hospital discharged patients without any such protocol. After being brought to the hospital by bus, patients were left to arrange their own transportation home. Some patients had to hire rickshaws to return to Shertha. The hospital’s strategy involved conducting free medical camps only once in a particular village. One of the hospital's directors allegedly played a key role in organising these free camps. They maintained regular contact with community leaders and political figures in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, and north Gujarat villages, claiming they wanted to serve the poor by offering free heart disease treatments.

Gujarat eases non-agricultural land permit rules: Premium on jantri cut from 30% to 10%,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-eases-non-agricultural-land-permit-rules-premium-on-jantri-cut-from-30-to-10,2024-11-19,19,11,2024,"To speed up the process and introduce more transparency to the process of revised non-agricultural (NA) permits, Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel on Tuesday reduced the premium on Jantri prices. Currently, when any proposal of land previously NA for any purpose in the State is presented to the District Collector for repurposing, if the premium is leviable and the premium remains to be levied at the time of the previous NA decision, such premium of 30% of the prevailing jantri rate is levied. In the past, premium amount was applicable for the lands of restricted authority and of ‘undivided’ condition, but in lands where NA was granted without recovery of such amount, the revised non-cultivation permission will now be charged at a premium amount of 10% of the prevailing jantri price from the existing applicant/occupier. However, in his tweet, CM Patel clarified that this decision will not be applied where premium recovery has already been decided. This comes after various sections of the society had urged the chief minister for the reform, to which, he has now responded positively.

GPSC to conduct separate examinations for Part-1 and Part-2 papers,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gpsc-to-conduct-separate-examinations-for-part-1-and-part-2-papers,2024-11-26,26,11,2024,"The Gujarat Public Service Commission (GPSC) is set for reforms, raising hopes of candidates. For the exams scheduled in December 2024 and January 2025, the GPSC has decided to prepare a single question paper for Part-1 of 8 out of a total of 11 recruitments, as these 8 exams share the same syllabus for General Studies. The evaluation process will follow thereafter. As per GPSC’s announcement, the General Studies syllabus is the same for 8 of the 11 recruitments planned for 2024-25, while the remaining three have a different syllabus. Previously, a single question paper was prepared for Part-1 and Part-2 of each recruitment, requiring the preparation of 11 separate question papers, answer keys, and evaluations for Part-1 alone. This consumed considerable time and delayed the recruitment process. To address this, the GPSC decided to separate the question papers for Part-1 and Part-2. Under the new approach, a single question paper will be prepared for Part-1 of the 8 exams, allowing streamlined evaluation. For the remaining 3 recruitments, separate Part-1 question papers will be created and evaluated independently. These changes aim to reduce processing time and expedite the recruitment process. The recruitment for positions such as deputy director of horticulture, scientific officer, technical advisor, lecturer (selection scale) – nursing, lecturer (senior scale); nursing, assistant engineer (civil); assistant engineer (electrical), and junior town planner will have a common Part-1 exam scheduled for January 12, 2025. Meanwhile, recruitments for assistant manager, additional assistant engineer, and station officer will have a separate Part-1 exam on January 19, 2025. Candidates will need to download a single admit card for both Part-1 and Part-2 of the preliminary exam. The move comes after the appointment of new GPSC Chairman Hasmukh Patel.

To curb the nuisance of drugs, Gujarat becomes India’s first state to launch a special Narco Reward Scheme to combat drug abuse. The policy rewards informants with up to 20% cash rewards of the seized value. To support police officers, employees, and informers’ efforts and deter the spread of narcotics, the Gujarat government introduced the Narcotics Reward Policy. This initiative encourages police personnel, employees, and informers by offering incentives and is implemented by the state’s home department. Under the policy, rewards are granted in the following cases— 1. Informants who provide information that leads to the seizure of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, and illegally acquired property under the NDPS Act, 1985. 2. Authorised officers under the NDPS Act, 1985, who successfully seize illegal substances, conduct successful investigations or prosecutions, and substantiate the crime through post-investigation actions. 3. Officers from other departments who assist in addressing violations of the NDPS Act, 1985. How is the reward amount determined? The reward amount for informants is determined based on the specificity and accuracy of the information provided about the seizure, the level of risk involved, and the significance of the information. For government employees or officers making successful seizures, factors such as the effort involved, the risk taken during the operation, their vigilance, and any arrests related to the prohibited substances are considered. Officers or employees who provide evidence as part of their regular duties are not eligible for a reward. Reward of up to 20% of seized substance’s value Under the NDPS Act, of 1985, informants are eligible for a reward of up to 20% of the illegal market value of the seized substances. For government employees, the total maximum reward during their career is ₹20 lakh, with a limit of ₹2 lakh per individual case. Private individuals who assist in office work receive ₹2,500 per case. In the event of the death of an informant or government employee, the reward may be given to their legal heir or nominee. This reward is granted as a prize and is approved by the relevant authorities. Drugs and Gujarat Gujarat Police has confiscated 87,607 kilograms of drugs valued at ₹16,155 crore and apprehended over 2,500 suspects. Under the policy, the DGP Committee has approved rewards totalling ₹51,202 for 64 people, while the ACS, Home-level Committee has sanctioned ₹6.36 crore for 169 individuals.

The Gandhinagar Secretariat houses four main parking areas. One is specially designated for legislators, while the remaining ones are used by Sachivalaya staff, officers, ministers, and visitors. Within these parking lots, several government vehicles that are no longer in use have been abandoned. At one point, the grand Secretariat compound in the heart of Gandhinagar, actively housed government vehicles used for official transport. Today, these once-luxurious cars from brands like Toyota, Suzuki, and Mahindra are left to gather dust. The vehicles that once symbolised the prestige of secretaries now stand faded, rusty, and decaying. Prolonged disuse has led to issues like dust accumulation, rust, jammed parts, and peeling paint, reducing their value and unnecessarily occupying parking space, causing inconvenience. When condemned government vehicles are disposed of, they are listed on the government auction department's website, and the terms of the auction are published. The upset price of the condemned vehicle is determined based on the resolution of the home department, orders from the finance department, and the mechanical division's report. After the auction, the buyer is responsible for transporting the vehicle at their own expense.

Amidst the uproar, some municipalities including Anand are issuing simple birth and death records through stamps.

Due to lack of proper arrangements and transportation, many candidates, despite filling out the forms, are unable to take the exams, resulting in missed opportunities for government jobs. He urged GPSC to allocate exam centres closer to candidates' hometowns. He also alleged that candidates have raised concerns about the clarity and quality of questions. Some questions are ambiguous, and there are instances where GPSC’s so-called subject experts are not even aware of foundational facts, such as the date of Gujarat’s establishment. Candidates demand that such experts be removed from the recruitment process, and the commission should eliminate the fees collected to cover up these errors. Regarding the delayed results, Chavda wrote that the delay in the announcement of results is causing frustration and dissatisfaction among candidates. For instance, more than 4.5 months have passed since the main exam of the Deputy Section Officer was conducted, but the results are yet to be declared. Candidates are requesting that the results for advertisements 20/22-23, 47/23-24, and 45/2023-24 be announced promptly. He also urged for relaxation in age criteria, comparing Gujarat's policies to those of other states. For example, in neighbouring Rajasthan, there is a provision to increase the age limit by three years if no announcement is made for three years. Candidates believe Gujarat should adopt a similar policy.",gandhinagar
"Gandhinagar Secretariat staff object to digital attendance, write to CM",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gandhinagar-secretariat-staff-object-to-digital-attendance-write-to-cm,2025-01-29,29,01,2025,"A digital attendance system is to be implemented from February 1, 2025, was opposed by the Gujarat Secretariat Staff Association. A General Administration Department circular dated January 27, 2025, mandated digital attendance for officers/employees in all departments of the Secretariat complex, government offices of Karmayogi Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Collector and DDO office – Gandhinagar. The association alleged that although this circular is related to the interests of employees-officers, no communication has been made with the government employees or employee unions, who are the main stakeholders in this policy. This policy has been declared unilaterally, against which this association expresses strong objection and opposition. The employees’ association further stated that in response to this circular, the association has brought the following issues and concerns to the notice of the government and has submitted a proposal to maintain the current system for attendance (Integrated Security Access Control and Man Management System) in the Secretariat. The association submitted in writing to the Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel that the digital attendance system is like a surveillance system against the privacy of the employees due to various permissions like location of the employee’s personal device and camera. When the employees play the role of ‘Karma Yogi’ in the development of the state and perform their duties with commitment and sincerity even after staying late after the office hours, such unilateral decisions weaken the morale of the employees and are mentally discouraging, argued the employees. In this policy, since the personal smart phones of the employees are to be used for government work without consent, it is inconvenient for the employees and this policy is completely inappropriate, wrote the association. This system will collect the personal data of the employee through location monitoring third party application, the lack of a responsible system for the security of this data and the unclear policy will be a violation of the fundamental right to privacy of the employee, it said. The letter further read that the serious challenges to the security of the employee’s personal data cannot be denied and continuous surveillance of the employee through the application is tantamount to a violation of the employee's ‘right to disconnect’. The association has demanded that this policy may cause harassment of the female employees of the subordinates due to the use of location and face attendance data from the camera. Therefore, this association expresses its complete opposition to the introduction of this Digital Attendance System and requests to maintain the existing Integrated Security Access Control and Man Management System for Attendance.",gandhinagar

Police install barricades to stop commuters using slip road near ‘Kamalam’,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/police-install-barricades-to-stop-commuters-using-slip-road-near-kamalam,2025-02-03,3,02,2025,"A slip road created illegally by commuters to enter the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar highway, near the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters ‘Kamalam’ in Koba, has been closed by the police. The move was undertaken to prevent frequent accidents at the location, Gandhinagar Traffic Police sources said. As per the sources, “The slip road near Kamalam is infamously known as ‘death road’. It was earlier cordoned off with iron rods and wires by the traffic police . Soon after, commuters opened it up and drove dangerously, causing fatal accidents.” To prevent such untoward incidents, the Traffic Police Inspector directed his personnel to close the road on Sunday. Subsequently, the Infocity traffic police personnel closed this illegal road with barricades, iron chains and locks. The authorities are sceptical if the commuters would still try to pry open the barricades and use the ‘cut’, a dangerous manoeuvre that leads to frequent accidents on site. As recent as last month, a tragic incident took place on the service road near ‘Kamalam’, from Gandhinagar to Koba Circle. A person driving an Activa was hit by a car and lost his life. A case was registered against the car driver at the Infocity police station. In June 2023, the absence of barricades led to an accident near the BJP headquarters, where a man lost his life and his daughter was critically injured.",gandhinagar
Gujarat sets up committee to implement Uniform Civil Code,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-announces-committee-to-implement-uniform-civil-code,2025-02-04,4,02,2025,"After Uttarakhand, the BJP-ruled Gujarat announced the formation of a committee for implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) on Tuesday. Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi said that a historic decision has been made. A committee has been formed to draft the UCC proposal. Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel said that ‘Indianness’ is our religion, and the Constitution is our ‘sacred text’. “As we celebrate 75 years of the Constitution, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided to implement a uniform law across the country to ensure equal rights,” he said. A committee will be formed under the leadership of retired Supreme Court judge Ranjana Desai. Other members of the committee will include retired IAS C L Meena, advocate R C Kodekar, former vice chancellor Dakshesh Thaker and social worker Geetaben Shroff. This committee will submit its report within 45 days, after which the state government will make a decision. The state has 15% tribal population, and several areas in the state are under disturbed zones. Regarding this, Sanghavi assured that nothing in the UCC will harm the customs and traditions of the tribal community. He assured that full consideration will be given to preserving the traditions and customs of the tribal communities. This comes after the Gujarat government approved the formation of a committee in 2022 to explore the feasibility and necessity of UCC in the state. The panel’s role is to examine the need for such a code and prepare a draft for its implementation. What is the Uniform Civil Code? UCC means a common civil code or common law for every citizen residing in India irrespective of religion and caste. The UCC falls under Article 44 of the Constitution, which refers to directive principles of state policy. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) states that the state shall undertake to offer a unified set of laws to its citizens within the Indian law. The rationale is to regulate the population and apply uniform rules for marriage, divorce, adoption, and inheritance across all religions. The UCC aims to ensure equality in personal relationships and family rights, eliminating gender, religious, or traditional biases. Moreover, it ensures that no specific religion is given special legal privileges. Last month, Uttarakhand created history on becoming the first state in India to implement the UCC.

With a debt-to-GSDP ratio of just 18.2%, Gujarat has one of the lowest debt ratios among major states. Gujarat has achieved this while maintaining an average interest rate on state securities at 7.5% with an average maturity of 7.4 years, as per report. According to the NCAER Working Paper ‘The State Of The States: Federal Finance In India’ by Barry Eichengreen and Poonam Gupta, Gujarat, along with Odisha and Maharashtra, maintains a debt level below 20% of state GDP, significantly lower compared to states like Punjab (47.6%), where the ratio is nearly 50%. Key Fiscal Indicators - Financial Discipline: Gujarat demonstrates over 90% compliance with key fiscal parameters, including Revenue Deficit, Fiscal Deficit, and Outstanding Liabilities. - Fiscal Deficit: The state’s average 10 year primary deficit remains notably low at 0.3% of GSDP. - Economic Growth: Gujarat has achieved a 12% growth in GSDP. Gujarat's approach to fiscal management ensures financial stability while fostering economic growth. This balance of controlled borrowing with economic expansion sets an example. The NCAER paper, analysing 21 major states, highlights significant variability in debt levels. Gujarat, alongside Odisha, West Bengal, and Maharashtra, demonstrates fiscal prudence, while most other states have experienced rising debt-to-GSDP ratios over the last decade.",gandhinagar

Will Gujarat DGP get extension or new top cop come in? Lobbying gathers steam,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/lobbying-picks-up-in-ips-circles-ahead-of-gujarat-dgps-retirement-in-june,2025-02-18,18,02,2025,"Who will be the new police chief of Gujarat? is a question that is being discussed in the bureaucratic corridors in Gujarat. With Director General of Police (DGP) Vikas Sahay set to retire by the end of June, there is already a buzz in police circles about the next top cop. The cause of the discussion is the ongoing ‘cold war’ within the Gujarat Police. Lobbying within the Indian Police Service community has already begun, with some pushing for an extension for DGP Sahay, while others aim to seize the opportunity. Currently, the Haryana and Rajasthan lobbies are the strongest, and there is a belief that the ongoing ‘cold war’ among senior officers might create problems for the government. Discussions are brewing that the government may appoint a non-controversial officer who understands the current crime situation, avoiding conflict. One possible scenario could be that Sahay receives a three-month extension or Ahmedabad Commissioner of Police G S Malik is appointed DGP. Senior-most officer Dr Shamsher Singh has been transferred to a central deputation, leading to several names being speculated. IPS Manoj Agrawal from the 1991 batch will retire in September, so it seems unlikely he will be appointed DGP for a few months. Under such circumstances, the current head of the jail department, Dr K L N Rao, is the most senior officer. Dr Rao, from the 1992 batch, is set to retire in October 2027. If he is appointed, his tenure would be long, but his long-standing side-track posting in the jail department and his perceived distance from the government make his appointment less likely. Consequently, G S Malik, the current Ahmedabad CP seems to be the most likely candidate for DGP. CP Malik, although not the senior-most officer of the 1993 batch and originally from Haryana, has made a significant impression on the BJP high command with his work during his deputation at the Centre and his time as BSF Commander. He has served in key positions in Gujarat, including as Additional Commissioner of Police in Vadodara, Joint Commissioner of Police in Ahmedabad Special Branch, and as the Home Secretary. Despite his relatively lower position in the seniority list, his broad experience in both the police and home departments makes Malik a top contender for DGP. There are several reasons behind the speculation that the current Ahmedabad CP could become DGP, surpassing other senior officers. In the past, Gujarat’s IPS lobby was dominated by the south and north lobbies, but currently, the Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Gujarat lobbies are actively lobbying within the system. Moreover, a shift in mentality is taking place within the Gujarat Police. Newer officers are no longer expected to follow traditional practices of showing deference to seniors. In the past, it was customary for junior officers to visit their seniors after a transfer, but this practice has diminished. There is now a shift towards a more professional, less hierarchical structure in the force. Furthermore, an incident involving a young IPS officer, who was seen attending a Coldplay concert while on duty in Ahmedabad, has become a topic of discussion within the police force. Despite being assigned duty at the event, the officer was reportedly on leave due to illness and was later seen enjoying the concert in casual attire, which raised eyebrows among colleagues.

In a smart meter, the data regarding the electricity consumption of the electricity consumer and other information is available to the consumer on a regular and immediate basis on their phone through the smart meter application. The department further hails the meters for their customer-friendly features, including their ability to communicate with both the customer and the distribution company.

To address complaints of excessive fees, the state government has amended the cooperative society law to regulate transfer fees and ensure fair practices. On Monday, the state government introduced amendments to the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961 and established certain regulations. According to these new rules, during the purchase or sale of a house in a housing or housing service society, the transfer fee cannot exceed 0.5% of the total transaction amount or a maximum of ₹1 lakh, whichever is lower. This amount is the upper limit, and societies can reduce the transfer fee at their discretion. However, under no circumstances can they charge more than this prescribed limit. After receiving numerous complaints, the government decided to implement necessary regulations related to transfer fees to prevent overcharging in housing and housing service societies. Regarding this matter, Cooperative Minister Jagdish Vishwakarma stated that individuals will also receive significant relief from actions taken by society presidents, chairmans, and committee members for collecting transfer fees during the purchase or sale of properties. According to these new regulations, if a legally rightful heir inherits a property without any monetary exchange, then no transfer fee can be charged. Additionally, societies will not be allowed to collect any amount under the guise of development charges, donations, or any other name during the transfer process. The move aims to bring bring more regulation to the functioning of societies and provide significant relief to the millions of members associated with them in the future.

Some of these officers were experienced and had a deep understanding of the state matters. Many IPS officers have expressed concerns that these officers are being taken to the Centre and given ordinary posts, leading to their expertise being wasted, as per reports. As per brewing discussions among the bureaucratic circles, the BJP high command is utilising Gujarat's IPS officers to maintain its dominance over central agencies, thereby squandering their strengths. Senior officers such as Shamsher Singh, Manoj Shashidharan, Himanshu Shukla, Dipen Bhadran, Shobha Bhutada, V Chandrasekhar, Rajiv Ranjan Bhagat, and others could have contributed significantly in Gujarat. However, they have been sent on deputation to the Centre, where their talent, skills, and intelligence are not being fully utilised, bureaucratic circles believe. Most of the IPS officers deputed from Gujarat have been assigned to the CBI, CISF, BSF, Jammu and Kashmir, Intelligence, and various Army divisions. Notable officers and their backgrounds Dr Samsher Singh, a 1991 batch IPS officer from Haryana, exposed a ₹300 crore checkpoint scam as the head of ACB, benefiting the government significantly. He also took action against corrupt IAS officers. Manoj Shashidhar, originally from Kerala and a 1994 batch IPS officer, was deputed to the centre on June 28, 2023. Himanshu Shukla, a 2005 batch IPS officer from Madhya Pradesh, has a B Tech degree. Since January 1, 2022, he has been serving in India’s intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing. Dipen Bhadran, a 2007 batch IPS officer from Kerala, has been on central deputation since July 21, 2024. Manoj Shashidhar, Himanshu Shukla, and Dipen Bhadran have previously served in the Ahmedabad Crime Branch and Gujarat ATS, playing key roles in countering terrorism. They have led major operations against dangerous criminals, drug traffickers, and even Pakistani infiltrators. Shobha Bhutada, a 2008 batch IPS officer from Latur, Maharashtra, has a background in Political Science.

The police intervened and detained the demonstrators on Wednesday in Gandhinagar. The state government, following a directive from the central government, recently issued a circular stating that students securing admission through the management quota would no longer be eligible for scholarships. On October 28, 2024, Gujarat’s government had updated the policy, declaring that students admitted under the vacant quota would automatically be categorised under the management quota. Protesting students argue that this decision is unfair and will deprive over 50,000 tribal students of their rightful scholarships under the post-matric scholarship scheme. They claim that many educational institutions, including those offering diplomas, degrees, pharmacy, and nursing courses, have already granted admissions under the vacant quota, with students receiving freeship cards. Now, owing to the revised policy, these students face the risk of losing financial assistance. “The government must immediately revoke this arbitrary decision,” demanded a protesting student. “If students have already been issued freeship cards, how can they now be denied scholarships?” The demonstration was met with police action, leading to the detention of several protestors.

The Speaker interrupted him, stating, “You can express your happiness, but keep it brief. If you prolong it, time will be wasted.” The Speaker expressed his frustration, saying, “We should not waste Assembly time merely for offering congratulations.

Just as congratulations are not to be given during this time, criticism should also be avoided. There is ample time for congratulations and criticism during the Governor’s address and Budget discussions. These matters should be kept out of Question Hour.” Rajkot MLA Dr Darshita Shah and Congress MLA Dr Tushar Chaudhary also made the same mistake.

According to government data, in the last two years, 1,359 more families in Gujarat have fallen into poverty. When half of Gujarat is forced to rely on free foodgrains, the government is celebrating it as an ‘achievement’. Amidst talks of prosperity, people in cities cannot even afford to spend ₹32 per day, while in rural areas, this amount is only ₹26 per day.

Congress leader Amit Chavda raised concerns about the rising crimes in the state. He claimed that the government’s lies have been revealed. On one hand, the government admits to sealing 2,200 illegal mining pits, but on the other, it has only issued 30 legal mining leases. He further alleged that bribery is a norm in the mining department, allowing the mining mafia to operate fearlessly. In Surendranagar, out of the 30 legal leases covering 78 hectares, there are reportedly over 300 illegal mines. These illegal operations are said to extract 1,000 tonnes of coal daily, adding up to 20,000 tonnes of coal being illegally mined and sold every day. Chavda accused officials of taking bribes worth crores, which led to heated arguments between BJP and opposition MLAs in the Assembly. The uproar escalated, and Speaker Shankar Chaudhary intervened, stating that accusations without evidence cannot be made in the Assembly. Meanwhile, a government minister responded by saying that the government regularly maps mining leases and, based on 12 mapped leases, complaints and applications were reviewed. The opposition also alleged  that criminals, including land mafias and anti-social elements, are thriving without any fear of legal action against them. Recent incidents in Surat and Navsari have raised serious concerns about the state’s law and order situation.

(Khoti jamin Mapani bandh kro) Khava, who represents Jamjodhpur, stated that farmers in Gujarat have been struggling for the past 10 years due to errors in land measurement records. He pointed out that in 2016 alone, over 25,000 applications relating to land survey errors were submitted. However, in the last decade, out of 83,000 applications, only 13,000 have been resolved, while the rest are pending. He alleged that the surveys were conducted to benefit BJP-affiliated individuals rather than addressing farmers’ concerns. Khava claimed that despite 160 MLAs being present in the Assembly, he was suspended without any official rule violation only because he wore a T-shirt highlighting the issue. Addressing the Assembly, Khava cited an example from his constituency, stating that farmer Dev Navdariya from Modpar village in Lalpur taluka lost 2.8 acres of land from official records. Despite ten years of running from office to office, he is yet to receive justice. In Jamnagar district, a total of 83,467 applications regarding post-promulgation land record corrections have been submitted to the District Land Records (DLR) office over the past ten years. However, only 13,500 applications have resulted in changes to land ownership records, while not a single application has led to corrections in village maps. Khava argued that without amendments in village maps, the errors cannot be considered resolved. Commenting on the land survey issue, Khava highlighted that in 2009-10, a private agency was tasked with conducting land surveys across Gujarat under the promulgation process. However, while the survey was completed in just four years by 2014, the government has been working on correcting its errors for the past ten years, with no clear timeline for resolution.",gandhinagar

There are over  4500 vacancies for Khel Sahayaks in the state. However, out of 4,565 vacant positions, only 1,465 candidates have been included in the merit list, leaving 3,100 positions remaining unfilled. The state government has not provided any clear answer as to when these vacancies will be filled. Previously, the state government had announced positions on an 11-month contract basis, and 1,465 candidates accepted these positions. After their contract period ended, they demanded a renewal of their jobs. The protesting candidates in Gandhinagar are now urging the government to make permanent appointments based on the SAT results. Physical education teachers in Gujarat have been protesting for the past two days, demanding an end to contractual recruitment and the immediate hiring of permanent physical education teachers. Meanwhile, the government has published the merit list for Khel Sahayak (Primary) recruitment on the recruitment portal on Wednesday. According to sources, the candidates who had accepted employment were clearly informed that it was an 11-month contractual position, making them ineligible for permanent appointments.So, the eligible candidates are seeking a structured recruitment process, similar to TET and TAT exams, for the recruitment of Khel Sahayaks to fill the vacant positions. What physical education teachers are demanding –No permanent recruitment of physical education teachers has been done in Gujarat for the past 15 years. There is a need to initiate permanent hiring. –Permanent recruitment of physical education teachers currently occurs only at the secondary and higher secondary levels. Even then, the number of hires is much lower than the available vacancies according to the roster system. No recruitment has been conducted for primary schools (Grades 1-8). So, permanent physical education teachers for primary schools are also required. - The SAT conducted by the State Examination Board (SEB) should be considered valid for permanent recruitment. - At the time of conducting the SAT, the government had declared around 5,075 vacant physical education teacher positions. These positions should now be permanently filled. - Since no recruitment has taken place for the last 15 years, a new Government Resolution (GR) and framework should be created, and an official announcement for immediate permanent recruitment should be made. All degree-holding physical education teacher candidates, Khel Sahayaks, and aspirants waiting for recruitment are demanding that the government stop contractual recruitment and proceed with permanent hiring. Instead of contractual hiring, recruitment should be done based on the provisions of the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, which have made physical education a mandatory subject. Considering this, the Gujarat government, through its Education department, should take independent policy decisions that will help the state produce future athletes and sportspersons who can elevate Gujarat’s name at the national and international levels. For the holistic physical and mental development of students, physical education should be recognised as a full-time subject, and the SAT exam should be accepted as a qualification criterion for the permanent recruitment of physical education teachers.",gandhinagar

This was in context of the House discussing issues of fixed salary, outsourcing and contract-based employees. The opposition demanded a decent salary for the employees, including Asha workers, Anganwadi sisters, sanitation workers, multipurpose health workers, and home guards. Many employees have filed petitions in the high court and the Supreme Court demanding that the benefits of minimum wage, gratuity, and provident funds be made permanent, the opposition stated, seeking a positive solution from the state government in this direction. Carrying forward the discussion, Congress MLA Jignesh Mevani noted that the state government had increased the minimum wage for agricultural labourers to ₹476 per day from ₹375 per day after 23 years. However, Mevani alleged that workers are still paid ₹375 per day by the sugarcane mafia which doesn’t pay heed to the government circular. He added that a sugarcane worker works for an average of five to six months. According to a trade union survey, the number of such sugarcane workers in the state is 1.5 lakh. If they are still paid ₹375 per day, it translates to ₹550 crore of unpaid wages over a year. He also mentioned that many of these workers suffer from silicosis (a lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust). To prevent this, the Human Rights Commission issued special guidelines in 2017.

The students have blamed the university’s apathy and negligence for the death of the student. The 21-year-old ended his life on the university campus on Monday. The students have slammed  GNLU, claiming it has now become “synonymous with institutional apathy, negligence, and gross mismanagement”. The students alleged that the tragedy was a “culmination of administrative negligence, the lack of medical preparedness, and the suppression of student voices, notably through the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), which is meant to safeguard students from harassment and ensure their protection”. The students body has released a a timeline of the events on the night of the tragedy. 11.32 pm – A concerned friend knocked on Vansh’s door after repeated failed attempts to contact him. 11.39-11.48 pm – Multiple calls made by students went unanswered. A message was sent to the batch group at 11.48 pm, raising alarm about his well-being. 11.50 pm – A video was sent showing Vansh’s feet visible from under the door, yet the warden downplayed the situation, leading to a 25-minute delay in taking action. Frustrated by the warden’s inaction, students forcibly broke open the door themselves. The warden abandoned the rescue attempt midway, claiming “nothing is happening”, leaving the students to carry the full responsibility of saving their friend. 12.19 am – Students broke open the door, cut the cloth from which Vansh was hanging, and laid him down. 12.25 am – Medical staff arrived—30 minutes too late. 12.35-12.40 am – Vansh was taken from the college. 12.45-12.50 am – He reached the hospital. Lack of emergency equipment and warden’s inaction The students alleged that the hostel lacked emergency equipment such as crowbar or ladder to access the window. The statement also noted that the warden’s inaction resulted in students having to break open the door themselves after ‘nearly 25 minutes of inaction’. No medical assistance As per students, despite repeated requests, no medical personnel arrived on time, leaving students to handle the emergency on their own. In a desperate attempt to get help, students had to fetch a nurse from the girls’ hostel, as there was no medical staff present in the boys’ hostel. When medical staff finally arrived, they did not know how to perform CPR and instead asked students if they knew how to proceed, alleged the students. Further, no ambulance was arranged after the door was broken, and the administration failed to take any action. Students had to organise a car themselves and Vansh was taken to the hospital without any staff accompanying him. Allegations against warden Allegations were made against the warden, Yogesh, of targeting Vansh ‘without any reason’. Talking about a particular incident, the statement said that a few months ago, the warden had held Vansh’s jaw tightly, in a “clear instance of battery and bullying”. The students have alleged that lack of emergency infrastructure, medical preparedness, and administrative responsibility has caused the death that could have been prevented. Demand for justice Now, the students demand an independent inquiry into the administrative failure that led to this tragedy, immediate suspension of warden, and implementation of emergency measures. Failure in student representation “The ICC at GNLU, meant to protect students from sexual harassment, has been rendered ineffective. Despite the High Court’s cognizance of the issue and its directives for the university to ensure a functional, student-inclusive ICC, the administration has failed to implement these recommendations. The current ICC remains predominantly under administrative control, suppressing student voices instead of providing justice,” said the students. They alleged that sensitisation programmes, crucial to the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) policy, have been poorly conducted, creating an atmosphere of fear and silence.",gandhinagar
Gujarat govt imposes ESMA on striking health workers,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-govt-imposes-esma-on-striking-health-workers,2025-03-20,20,03,2025,"Gujarat’s health workers have launched an indefinite strike, demanding resolution of their long-pending issues. On March 18, in Botad, health employees submitted a memorandum to the District Collector, emphasising their need for justice. They warned that if their demands were not met, the union would take stricter action. In response, the state government has now taken a significant step. The Gujarat government, on Wednesday, invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against the striking health workers. Under this law, health services are classified as essential, meaning that employees refusing to return to work could face severe consequences. The state government has hinted that fixed-pay employees participating in the strike could face termination. Notably, essential services like police and energy departments are already covered under ESMA. The striking employees, including Multi-Purpose Health Workers, Female Health Workers, and other medical staff, are demanding the cancellation of departmental exams, removal of salary discrepancies, and the implementation of technical grade pay. Their strike has intensified, with protest gatherings and demonstrations taking place across Gujarat. The health workers’ protest is not new. Earlier, similar demonstrations were held in Khambhaliya, Dwarka, where employees submitted a memorandum to the Collector's Office. In Gandhinagar, protests were staged near the Satyagraha Chhavani. Despite repeated appeals, health workers feel their concerns have been ignored, leading them to take drastic steps. As the strike continues, the state government and protesting workers remain at a standoff. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether a resolution can be reached or if the confrontation escalates further. The Gujarat Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) of 1972 is a legislative measure aimed at ensuring the uninterrupted delivery of essential services within the state. Under this Act, the government holds the authority to prohibit strikes in services deemed essential to public welfare. The Act defines “essential services” to include all employment under the state government, encompassing officers and servants of the State Legislature Secretariat and the High Court. Additionally, any employment that the state government considers crucial for maintaining public utility services, public safety, or essential supplies can be declared as an essential service through a notification in the Official Gazette. In situations where the state government deems it necessary in the public interest, it can issue orders to prohibit strikes in these essential services. Such orders are published in a manner intended to effectively inform the affected individuals.

Several police officers in Gujarat are involved in extortion, land deals, and collecting hefty bribes, alleged the opposition leader. In Mahatma Gandhi’s Gujarat, the law exists only on paper. Since the police accept bribes from bootleggers, liquor is being sold in every village and street across the state, said Chavda. Liquor is being smuggled into Gujarat from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Daman, and Silvassa, he noted. Chavda questioned the role of police in preventing the illegal liquor trend, and demanded that top police officials of Banaskantha, Mehsana, and Gandhinagar should be suspended. The Congress leader alleged that in Gujarat, some police officers take an undue interest in land disputes, encroachments, and controversial land settlements. In one such case, a bribe of ₹22 crore was taken. Several high-category officers in Gujarat are living lavish lifestyles beyond their legal income. A decision was recently made to prepare a list of criminals in the state. Similarly, it is necessary to prepare a list of dishonest officers in the Gujarat Police department. Criminals and gangsters are openly wielding swords and sticks, terrorising the public, and forcing them to live in fear. While the common people suffer, illegal mining and drug mafias are thriving unchecked. The police must take strict action against them.

The healthcare workers, demanding improvements in their grade pay, inclusion of technical pay, and exemption from departmental exams, had planned to submit a memorandum to Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel. Police began detaining them in their respective districts before they could proceed towards Gandhinagar. At key points along major roads, police stopped them from heading to Gandhinagar. A heavy police presence, including personnel from the Gandhinagar Police and Gandhinagar Range, enforced security in Gandhinagar. A three-layered security check was set up at Gate Number 1 near the Secretariat, preventing any further movement towards the CM’s office. The health employees union, which has been raising these demands for the past three years, expressed frustration over the lack of government response. Despite several attempts to engage with the government, no solution has been found, prompting today’s protest.

The official announcement about the expansion could be made early in the April, confirmed official sources. The Gujarat government currently has eight cabinet ministers apart from the chief minister and eight state-level ministers, which is now likely to increase, sources said. Although the old BJP leaders are unhappy with the place given to Congress leaders who switched parties in the cabinet expansion. However, as per the orders of the high command and the promise given to the turncoats, the BJP will include them in the cabinet. Due to that, Dr CJ Chavda and Arjun Modhwadia will be set in the cabinet, said sources. In addition, there has been confusion in the party high command over the name of the state president of the BJP, with no decision in sight. With the cabinet expansion, important portfolios of the state government will be redistributed, in which the additional charges of the ministers will be reduced and the work will be assigned to other ministers. The state government cannot expand the cabinet while the Gujarat assembly session is currently underway, but sources have given information that this cabinet expansion will take place after the March 27, around April 7. In the new cabinet, the party can also assign responsibility to a young leader who had previously left the Congress to join the BJP, for added youth representation in the cabinet.",gandhinagar

Currently hired on an 11-month contractual basis under the Khel Sahayak scheme, these teachers argue that no permanent hiring has taken place for the past 15 years. They are urging the government to end the contract-based system and initiate full-time recruitment. The Gujarat government’s Khel Sahayak (Sports Assistant) scheme has faced opposition from teachers, who claim it is unfair to both students and educators. Under the scheme, teachers are removed from their positions once their contract ends, even if they are actively training students. Teachers argue that this disrupts students’ growth in sports and physical education. Key issues raised by the protesting teachers –No uniform leave policy for sports assistants across the state. –Lack of clarity on salary payments after the 11-month contract period. –Verbal terminations without written notice or official circulars. –Delayed or missing salaries in some districts, especially in February. –Unnecessary renewal processes that add to job insecurity.

In the past one year, residents of Gujarat consumed a total of 24,000 litres of liquor in GIFT City, earning the state exchequer over ₹94 lakh in revenue. On December 30, 2023, the government granted permission to consume alcohol in GIFT City. Under the ‘Wine and Dine’ facility, employees working in GIFT City and visitors were allowed to consume alcohol. The state government's reasoning: GIFT City is being developed as a global business hub, so permitting alcohol consumption is necessary to attract foreign companies and investors. Leader of the Opposition in the Gujarat Assembly Amit Chavda had raised a question regarding the amount of foreign liquor and beer sold in GIFT City over the past year. In response, the government revealed that licenses for alcohol sales in GIFT City had been granted to Western India Recreation Project Pvt Ltd and The Grand Mercure. The government has benefited from alcohol sales in GIFT City, which has generated a revenue of ₹94.19 lakh. As much as 19,915 litres of beer and 3,324 litres of foreign liquor, totalling 23,907 litres of alcohol was sold in the past year. Looking at the revenue generated from the ‘Wine and Dine’ facility at GIFT City, discussions regarding starting such facility at other locations, including Surat’s Diamond Bourse, the Statue of Unity, and other tourist destinations, might weigh on the authorities' minds.

Today, the protesting teachers attempted to march towards the Gujarat Assembly, but before they could reach Gate No 1, the police intervened and detained them. In response to the ongoing protest, the police have increased security in Gandhinagar and are on high alert. However, the teachers have vowed not to leave Gandhinagar until their demands are met. The government has implemented the ‘Khel Sahayak Yojana’ for physical education teachers in Gujarat, but the protesters have rejected this scheme. They argue that the policy is neither in the interest of the teachers nor the students. The teachers claim that under this scheme, a student learning sports barely gets proper coaching, and just when they start progressing, their contract-based coach is removed. According to the physical education teachers, the scheme does not safeguard their rights. They argue that the leave policies are inconsistent, and there is no clarity on how the 11-month contract period is calculated, especially during vacations. Moreover, many teachers are terminated verbally without any written notice or official circular before completing their contract period, claimed the protestors.

Once the Bill goes through, court proceedings against those violating the conditions under various sections of Bombay Land Revenue Act, 1879, will be withdrawn. The Sections include– Section 65 (uses to which occupant may put his land for purposes of agriculture ), Section 68 (conditions where a person can occupy unalienated, unoccupied land, subject to rules prescribed by the state government), Section 84-C (empowers mamlatdar of proceeding on invalid land transfers post-1955 amendment, suo moto or on application), and Section 122 (disposal of land, transfer, or acquisition of which is invalid). If any condition related to non-agricultural (NA) permission under Section 65 has been violated and court proceedings have been initiated against the individual, those proceedings will be withdrawn. This action will be shifted to Section 79-A of the Gujarat Land Revenue Act. If a violation has occurred on land under the new conditions of Section 43 and a case has been filed, that will also be withdrawn. The amendment bill includes provisions to withdraw proceedings under Section 84-C if indivisible land, new condition land, or re-surveyed land has been sold without the collector’s approval. Experts in the matter suggest this provision has been added to the Gujarat Land Revenue Amendment Bill-2025. They further explain that if land under new conditions has been sold to another person without obtaining NA permission from the government, the government initiates court proceedings against the seller under Section 84-C and seeks clarification. If the explanation is unsatisfactory, the government takes possession of the land. The proposed amendment bill also introduces a provision where the government, after taking possession, can sell the land to another individual for a price. Similarly, if land under Section 43’s new conditions has been transferred without obtaining NA permission and a violation has occurred, any ongoing court proceedings will also be withdrawn.",gandhinagar

The penalty, which earlier stood at ₹200, is likely to  go up to ₹1 lakh, with ₹10,000 as minimum penalty. As per the new provision made in 1, 2, 3 of Section 62-A, in some cases, the amount of this penalty has been increased from ₹200 to ₹50,000. Stamp officer will now have power to impose jail sentence? A provision has been introduced to impose a fine of ₹500 on a person found guilty of violating Section 62-A for the first offence, ₹1,000 for the second offence, ₹2,000 and imprisonment for up to two years for the third and subsequent offences. With this, it is believed that stamp officials may also be granted power to impose jail sentences. Similarly, by proposing an amendment to Article 36, a provision has been introduced to increase the fine of ₹5000 for the foreclosed properties. On the other hand, a provision has been introduced to transfer the property to the heir son or daughter of the deceased without paying any other duty by simply giving a stamp of ₹200. It is worth mentioning that stamp duty was not levied before 1999. Now, when those properties are sold, the amount of duty is fixed to collect the duty. Earlier, the document could be cleared by depositing ₹250 in addition to the missing stamp duty amount, now as per the provision introduced through the new amendment bill, the property owner will have to deposit double the missing stamp duty amount as stamp duty. In such cases, if the missing stamp duty of 20 or 25 years is taken into account, a provision has also been introduced to add a penalty of 3% per year on it.

Notably, the state government had installed these solar pumps at the cost of ₹200 crore. As per reports, if these pumps were used, the state would have saved ₹600 crore in electricity costs. There is a provision for installing solar pumps in the Kusum Policy of the New and Renewable Energy Department of the Central Government. Not only in Gujarat but in the entire country, most of the solar controllers can run the motor to draw water for a maximum of 150 days in a year. While the solar controller equipped with USPC technology can be used for 320 days. Mentioning this, Congress MLA Jignesh Mevani cited an example in Rajasthan. The Ashok Gehlot government had installed 1,000 solar controllers equipped with USPC technology, benefitting a farmer who earned ₹6 lakh in one year for every six acres of land. Mevani alleged that in Gujarat, this number comes down to ₹11,000-12,000 for a farmer family. He added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had mentioned the technology in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ broadcast, and if the Government of Gujarat had listened to the PM, it would have helped the farmers of the state. The Congress MLA alleged that no tender has been floated yet for the implementation of the technology. If a budget of ₹5,000 crore is allocated for installing 2.5 lakh USPC pumps, it will significantly raise farmers’ income and make them financially independent.

As per the CAG report, 18.79% of children are still missing out on preschool education, and 6% remain unvaccinated under the immunisation program. Furthermore, the report highlights lack of services for low birth weight newborns and their mothers, both during pregnancy and after delivery. As per the 2011 Census, between 2015-16 and 2022-23, only 40.34 lakh children were enrolled out of the 77.77 lakh children who should have been registered  (aged 0-6 years). Under the Supplementary Nutrition Programme (SNP), 86% of the 4.63 crore registered beneficiaries received nutritional benefits. The audit also identified a shortfall of 16,045 Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) across the state. From 2015 to 2023, under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, 18.79% of children aged 3-6 years in AWCs did not receive preschool education. Despite years of efforts, full immunisation coverage is yet to be achieved. Under the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP), the state achieved 94% vaccination coverage for children up to one year old, still 6% short of the target. The percentage of low birth weight newborns decreased from 12.33% in 2017-18 to 11.63% in 2022-23, but it remains far from the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) 2017 goal of a 2% annual reduction. Additionally, the report flagged low registration of pregnant women and inadequate maternal and child healthcare services during pregnancy and post-delivery. Between 2015 and 2023, the coverage of essential maternal and newborn healthcare services – including Antenatal Care (ANC), Postnatal Care (PNC), immunisation, and the distribution of Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) tablets to pregnant and lactating mothers (P&LMs) – was significantly lower than the total number of registered P&LM beneficiaries in the healthcare system.

Twenty two out of the 33 districts in the state reported a shortage of over 25% shortage of doctors. The shortage of paramedics has also seen a rise in 19 districts. This situation calls for ensuring geographically equitable distribution of doctors and paramedics in Primary Healthcare Facilities (PHCFs). As many as 28% of the posts of specialist doctors in Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHs) are vacant, 36% in District Hospitals (DHs), and 51% in Sub-District Hospitals (SDHs) are vacant.

In this adverse situation, it is imperative for the state government to take immediate steps to appoint people in healthcare facilities along with medical and nursing colleges. Without addressing the workforce gap in healthcare, there will be challenges in improving the quality of public health services.

The doctors demand better reimbursement rates for cardiology treatments, claiming that the current rates are not in line with the inflation. The cost of treatment has increased continuously over the last decade. However, the package rates have not increased accordingly, which is creating obstacles in providing quality treatment to patients, claim the cardiologists. The forum said, “The aim of PMJAY is to make healthcare accessible. But the rates decided by ignoring the economic realities are a hindrance. Insufficient increase in PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) and other packages is making it difficult to provide interventional cardiology services under PMJAY.” If proper reforms are not made, interventional cardiology services under the PMJAY scheme will have to be stopped from April 1, stated the forum. Issues raised by cardiologists The rate of PCI under ‘MAA’ scheme in 2015 was ₹45,000, which is currently at ₹50,800 under PMJAY, which shows an annual growth rate of only 1.22%. Despite significant increase in equipment, staff, other expenses for treatment, the rates of the packages have remained the same Coronary angiography rackage rates remain unchanged since 2015 Despite being a life-saving treatment, IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump) not covered under PMJAY Disparity between CTVS (Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery) and PCI Packages No categorisation of cities for PMJAY package Representation to Collectors A representation in this regard was presented to the District Collectors of Gujarat.

These amendments aim to reduce citizen-centric rates and enhance administrative ease and convenience, thereby ensuring the effective implementation of Gujarat Stamp Amendment Bill 2025. The revised provisions of the Stamp Duty Act will come into effect across the state from April 10. The amendments introduced by the state’s Revenue Department mainly include: In cases of ancestral property, documents related to relinquishment of rights by the legal heirs of a deceased daughter can now be executed by paying a stamp duty of ₹200. For loans up to ₹1 crore, the maximum stamp duty payable will be limited to ₹5,000. For loan amounts above ₹10 crore, the current stamp duty cap of ₹8,00,000 for mortgage/hypothecation documents has been raised to ₹15,00,000. However, if loans are availed from more than one bank, then excluding surcharge, the maximum payable stamp duty will be ₹75,00,000. In cases of additional guarantees, a fixed stamp duty of ₹5,000 will now be required. In cases where less stamp duty has been paid and the applicant comes forward voluntarily to pay the due amount, the outstanding duty will be recovered at the rate of 2% per month, with a maximum penalty of up to four times the shortfall. If stamp duty evasion is detected by the authorities, it will be recovered at the rate of 3% per month, with a maximum penalty of up to six times the due amount. For rental/lease agreements of less than one year, instead of 1% of the average annual rent, the state government has now fixed stamp duty at ₹500 for residential and ₹1,000 for commercial properties. In cases of mortgage, if banks or financial institutions fail to pay stamp duty on executed documents, the responsibility for duty payment will lie with the respective banks/financial institutions. Additionally, if the original document is unavailable and less stamp duty was paid, duty can now also be recovered on the copy of the document. Apart from these revisions to the Gujarat Stamp Act, 1958, other amendments have also been made. These modifications are applicable to the base duty; additional duty (surcharge) will be levied as per legal provisions. Through these changes, the government claims to reduce the financial burden on industries and housing loan borrowers. The amendments related to relinquishment of rights in ancestral property is likely to resolve interpretational issues and reduce court matters and litigations arising due to ambiguities in existing legal provisions.

The Mamlatdar will register the land in the old tenure,” said Patel. The administrative process of conversion of conditions for purchase, sale and transfer of land will be simplified for farmers and common citizens. There will be no need to convert to the old tenure for setting up industry, business, or trade on premium-eligible lands for non-agricultural purposes and there will be an exemption from paying premium in government offices. The state revenue department has also made provisions for revenue title and legal occupant certificates to simplify the non-agricultural process. The concerned collector will make a decision within 30 days from the date of application. If a non-agricultural application is made after obtaining the certificate, then it will be informed within 10 days to pay the premium, penalty, conversion, or special duty.

"GIFT City relaxes prohibition rules: permits get easier, outsiders too can consume liquor",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gift-city-relaxes-prohibition-rules-permits-get-easier-outsiders-too-can-consume-liquor,2025-04-21,21,04,2025,"With the Gujarat government relaxing the implementation of the prohibition rule for liquor permits on the GIFT City campus, visitors too will be able to consume liquor. Now, employees and visitors at companies in GIFT City will be allowed to consume alcohol under more liberal rules. Under the revised policy, employees of GIFT City companies seeking liquor permits can now submit Form A-1 directly to an authorised officer, eliminating the previously required step of going through a ‘Recommending Officer’. With the elimination of the recommending officer requirement, liquor permits may now be issued even under the names of employees who haven’t applied for them. Earlier, companies were required to keep a record of how many of their employees had applied for permits, with verification done by senior officials like the HR head, PRO, or other responsible officers. Since each permit holder can invite five guests, even collecting 15–20 permits could be allowed for parties of over 100 people. According to an order issued by the Gujarat Home Department on April 15, 2025, conditions (10), (11), and (14) of the earlier order from December 30, 2023, regarding liquor serving in GIFT City, have been amended. As per the new condition (10), an employee of a GIFT City-based company must fill out Form-1 and submit it to the authorised officer to obtain a liquor access permit. The officer will verify the employment details and issue the liquor access card based on the information. When the Gujarat government permitted liquor service in GIFT City in December 2023, it was expected that alcohol would flow freely, but that didn’t happen. In the 16 months since, only 470 litres of wine, 3,324 litres of liquor, and 19,195 litres of beer have been sold — a very low volume. This resulted in minimal revenue for the government. According to police officials, liquor prices in GIFT City are too high, which is why sales within GIFT City remain low, as per reports.
