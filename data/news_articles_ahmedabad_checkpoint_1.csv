Controversy surrounds appointment of Manan Dani to GU executive council,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/controversy-surrounds-appointment-of-manan-dani-to-gu-executive-council,2024-10-04,4,10,2024,"Manan Dani The Gujarat University (GU), based in Ahmedabad, recently appointed Manan Dani as a nominee member of the Executive Council representing the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI). However, this appointment has come under scrutiny, with allegations that it was made without the knowledge or consent of the GCCI. In a letter to GU, the GCCI stated that they did not send any nominations for the position. This has raised questions about the legitimacy of the appointment and its adherence to established protocols. The Executive Council of GU was formed on November 6, 2023, under the Gujarat Public Universities Act, 2023. Out of the 22 positions, only 11 members were initially appointed, leaving 50% of the seats vacant. Recently, GU Vice Chancellor Dr Neerja Gupta exercised her authority to appoint two additional members. Manan Dani, who currently holds a position in the BJP’s IT cell, was appointed as the GCCI representative on the council. Reacting to this, GCCI’s additional secretary-general wrote to GU, clarifying that they had not nominated anyone for the Executive Council. The letter urged GU to send a nomination to GCCI for the position, which would then be forwarded to GU for consideration. Following this correspondence, reports have emerged indicating that a council meeting was recently held at GU, where this contentious issue was discussed in detail.",ahmedabad

"Man rams SUV into security guard, gets revenge for father's death 22 yrs ago",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/man-rams-suv-into-security-guard-gets-revenge-for-fathers-death-22-yrs-ago,2024-10-04,4,10,2024,"A man seeking revenge for his father’s death that happened 22 years ago in Rajasthan, allegedly rammed his SUV into a security guard in Ahmedabad after planning it for days, killing the guard. Takhatsinh, a security guard at a party plot in Bodakdev, was struck by an SUV when he was riding to his work on a bicycle. The incident occurred around 10 am on October 1, resulting in Takhatsinh’s death on the spot. Eyewitnesses quickly apprehended the jeep driver, identified as Gopalsinh, and handed him over to the N Division Police Station. Initially registered as a road accident, the case took a turn when suspicion arose due to the shared Rajasthan origins of both the victim and the driver. Upon reviewing CCTV footage, police discovered that Gopalsinh had been waiting for Takhatsinh and deliberately rammed into him. The lack of remorse on Gopalsinh’s face further fuelled suspicion, prompting a deeper investigation. During interrogation, Gopalsinh revealed a shocking motive, a 22-year-old revenge. In 2002, a quarrel between Harisinh, Gopalsinh’s father, and Takhatsinh in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, led to Takhatsinh running over Harisinh with an SUV. Takhatsinh was sentenced to jail for the incident. After serving his sentence, he moved to Ahmedabad three years ago, fearing that he would be killed in Rajasthan. Determined to avenge his father’s death, Gopalsinh meticulously planned the murder. He purchased a Bolero from Deesa three days prior and conducted a full recce of the area. On the morning of October 1, he executed his plan in the same manner as his father had been killed by Takhatsinh years earlier. The police had initially registered a road accident case which now has been reclassified into a murder case. Further investigation is on.

A short circuit led to other cables catching fire and the students were called outside their classes. As the computer lab of the institute is near the classrooms of the civil department, the power circuit of the lab was also damaged in the fire. The lab, therefore, was shut down and there was a power loss in the civil department of classrooms. As a result, the institute said the lab would not be operational for two days. According to reports, as soon as the smoke spread, the staff rushed to the fire alarm and the fire was extinguished by the fire safety equipment. The principal of the Government Polytechnic said that there are enough fire safety equipment and a fire safety system has been installed at a cost of ₹35 lakhs at the institute.

Considering the seriousness of the entire incident, the Gujarat High Court took a suo moto cognizance. During the hearing on October 3, the court described the incident as shameful. The bench, consisting of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Nisha Thakor, said that their heads hang in shame due to such incident. During the hearing, the court criticised the state government and said that we talk about development, but the government cannot even build a road in such a place. We can build tunnels in Jammu and Kashmir but cannot provide roads to villages. Justice Biren Vaishnav, sharing his personal experience, said that while visiting Rajpipla as the Chairman of the Legal Services Authority, it was extremely difficult to travel. Two kilometres further from Rajpipla, you would not find motorable roads. Just 15 km away from the Statue of Unity, there are no State Transport bus services, which is a distressful situation. “Think about the father of the children who has lost his wife,” the court said. The High Court directed the Gujarat Chief Secretary to reply to the court on this matter by October 17. A copy of this court order may also be sent to the Advocate General. Also, the Member Secretary of the Gujarat Legal Service Authority will contact the District Legal Service Authority and visit the family of the victim in this incident.

Public outrage has intensified following recent incidents of violence, and criticism directed at Home Minister Harsh Sanghavi’s comments on extending garba festivities until 5 am. In the past 15 days alone, six cases of rape and molestation have been reported across the state. These include the a murder of a 6-year-old girl by her school principal in Dahod, the molestation of a 5-year-old by a drunk man in Surendranagar, and the gang-rape of a teenager in Vadodara. Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi faced backlash for his statement suggesting that if we dont play garba in Gujarat then, ‘where will we play, in  Pakistan?’ This comment was widely criticised as insensitive and dismissive of the serious issues facing the state.

Gujarat textile industry in decline due to lack of new policy,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/gujarat-textile-industry-in-decline-due-to-lack-of-new-policy,2024-10-06,6,10,2024,"The Gujarat textile industry is facing a crisis, due to the absence of a textile policy for the past ten months now which has led to companies leaving the state. The previous textile policy lapsed on December 31, 2023, and since then no new policy has been introduced and Gujarat government has provided no indication of when it will be introduced. The lack of a textile policy has resulted in severe repercussions for the industry. The big companies are leaving for Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu with more attractive and profitable policies than Gujarat. While Gujarat remains a major producer of cotton, the region’s capabilities in yarn and fabric production are lagging. The cotton harvested in Gujarat is increasingly sent to neighbouring states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu for processing into yarn and fabrics. Gujarat has immense potential for growth in the textile sector, particularly in yarn and fabric production. With its extensive coastline, the state is well-positioned to enhance its processing capabilities. However, the lack of supportive policies and incentives has hindered the establishment of new spinning companies. Industry leaders are calling for immediate action by the Gujarat government, urging the introduction of a comprehensive textile policy that promotes small and new cotton industries. They propose increasing spinning capacity by 50% to revitalise the sector and suggest for a reduction in electricity rates for small industries by ₹2 per unit, along with interest subsidies on capital investments. The textile sector can create numerous job opportunities if the government prioritises the development of spinning and fabric manufacturing. Without a conducive environment and supportive policies, new players are struggling to enter the market, which ultimately affects the state’s economy.

Akash had admitted following an altercation with one Manish Patni, who had recently discovered that wife Rekha had had an affair with Akash. Rahul, Mukesh and Prashant stopped for chai near Gate 5 of the hospital on their way back. Here, Manish, his brother Mehul Patni, and their nephews Gadu and Ajay Patni — all brandishing knives and swords — confronted Mukesh over his perceived support for Akash. The enraged group attacked Mukesh first, turning on Rahul when the latter attempted to save his friend. Mukesh was taken to a hospital with multiple stab wounds, but died later, according to the police complaint later filed by Rahul, who survived the ordeal. Gadu and Mehul were injured when their attempt to flee the scene after the stabbing led to a crash with a road divider. Gadu has since been arrested, Shahibaug Police Inspector JD Zala told Gujarat Samachar Digital. “Mehul Patni is currently hospitalised under police surveillance, and we are actively searching for the other two suspects,” he added.

Private colleges, with fees running into lakhs, are not an option for these students, forcing them to rely on these under-resourced government institutions. The shortage of computers and related equipment means these students cannot gain the practical experience necessary for their courses. According to the information, teachers have been requesting additional computers from the government for years, but they have not received any computers yet. For quite a while now, it has been discussed that government may sanction 10,000 new systems, but no timeline has been given for the same. According to the norms of the Technical Council, there should be one computer for every ten students in degree and diploma colleges. With student numbers ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 in these government polytechnics, a minimum of 200 computers is required. Currently, these colleges do not even meet this minimum requirement leaving students with lack of practical knowledge Also read : Short circuit causes fire at Government Polytechnic in Ahmedabad",ahmedabad

I have also filed a written complaint with the Superintendent of Police (SP) regarding this matter.” Adding to his statement, he said, “We have also not received any assistance from IIM Ahmedabad. Whether it was regarding fees or any other matter, no help was extended to us, nor were we given the director’s name or contact number. No one even told us where or how to lodge a complaint.

Officials informed that the gang tricked a local resident by falsely claiming that their mobile phone was involved in illegal activities. The scammers further stated that a complaint had been filed against the individual at the Byculla police station in Mumbai. They used this claim to defraud the victim under the pretence of RBI verification. The gang convinced the complainant that their mobile number was linked to illegal activities, such as prohibited advertising, and that their bank account had suspicious transactions linked to their Aadhaar card. Using intimidation tactics, including threats of an arrest warrant, the criminals continuously monitored the complainant through WhatsApp calls. They pressured the victim to transfer ₹79,34,639 to a bank account under the guise of verification, promising to refund the money after the process was complete. A joint operation by the Cyber Crime Branch in Delhi and Bengaluru led to the arrest of two Taiwanese nationals, Mu Chi Sang and Chang Hao Yun (also known as Mark), who were key players in the scam. The police also arrested two more Taiwanese nationals in Bengaluru. A total of four foreign nationals were detained for their role in this elaborate fraud. The investigation revealed a sophisticated modus operandi involving 20 rooted mobile phones connected to routers, which intercepted OTPs from victims’ bank accounts. Over 120 mobile devices were linked to this setup, with operations spread across Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai. The gang was using rented bank accounts in exchange for commissions, provided by locals in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, and Odisha, eight of whom were arrested during the raids. Raids in Mumbai and Delhi also led to the arrest of Saif Haider, who was in direct contact with Mark, the Taiwanese mastermind. Mark was responsible for providing rooted mobile phones and routers and bringing equipment from Taiwan to set up illegal operations. He had travelled to multiple countries, including Cambodia, Dubai, China, and several cities in India, such as Bengaluru, Delhi, and Mumbai, to expand the fraudulent activities. During their recent trip to India on October 10, Mark and his associate Marco were attempting to expand their network by collecting rented bank accounts from Indian agents to use for illegal betting and cyber fraud. Two more Taiwanese nationals, Wang Chun Wei (aka Sumoka) and Shen Wei Hao (aka Krish), were arrested in Bengaluru. They were found to be operating a similar setup and were in contact with Saif Haider and other gang members. The cyber police seized ₹12.75 lakh in cash, 761 SIM cards, 120 mobile phones, 96 cheque books, 92 debit and credit cards, 48 cheques, 42 passbooks, 32 USB charging hubs, and other technical equipment, including minicomputers and routers. The gang used rooted mobile phones to intercept OTPs and access bank accounts for illegal activities, including cyber fraud, gaming, betting, and money laundering. This international gang’s operations were vast, with connections across multiple states, including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Odisha, Delhi, and Karnataka. The Cyber Crime Branch’s investigation continues, with efforts underway to apprehend more members involved in this elaborate scam.

The microphone system was set up after the mayor’s intervention.

Some tables at the programme were set up without any staff present, leaving applicants confused. There was no clear indication as to whom to approach for birth certificate updates. Several people struggled to decipher the boards on the tables like RBD and such, which left them confused. People were unable to understand the English and the short abbreviated words. Many applicants left disappointed due to a lack of responses and assistance. Notably, no notary was present at the designated table for document verification until 11.30 am.

Around 28 grant-in-aid colleges of Gujarat await grants from the government. The state government offers grants only to one class, considering 120 students per class.

Since the BCI approvals are pending with many institutions, the students are awaiting their turn for admission. The fees in granted colleges range from ₹1,000-₹1,500, whereas private colleges charge ₹1.5 lakh to 2 lakh per student. Yet, the granted colleges were fined ₹15 lakh to 20 lakh by the BCI. Students have demanded that the state government approve the necessary teaching staff and infrastructure in accordance with BCI regulations for grant-in-aid colleges, and  not take any action against such colleges till all the facilities are provided.

After Covid-19, a shift in health problems was observed. Earlier, spinal cord pain was primarily seen in individuals aged 50 or older, but there has been a notable increase in spinal issues among young people aged 25 and above . Experts from the Spine Institute at Ahmedabad’s Sola Civil Hospital note that two decades ago, most patients with spine-related problems were over the age of 50. But now patients in their 30s and 40s are reporting such issues. About spine-related issues in Ahmedabad, it has been observed that stress plays a crucial role in spinal injuries and related conditions. Stress can lead to what is known as ‘psychosomatic pain’, where the pain in the spine is caused due to excessive stress. Moreover, a sedentary lifestyle and poor posture– such as working on a laptop while lying down – contribute to spinal pain. Additionally, driving a 2-wheeler vehicle for a long period can be a factor in developing spine-related problems. Furthermore, children carrying heavy school bags are also increasingly reporting spinal pain.

The confrontation began when ADG Pandian asked the MLA and Pithadia to leave their phones outside the office. Mevani, in response, sought to know if the government had issued any notice or circular regarding phones, as phones are allowed in most government offices. This led to a heated argument between the MLA and the ADG. Mevani said that misbehaviour of police with top elected members of the state is unacceptable, and alleged that the police are not interested in listening to the issues of Dalits. “If the issues of Dalits are not heard, a petition will be filed in the high court,” he said. Mevani further alleged that IPS Pandian told him that the MLA was breaking the protocol by wearing a t-shirt to a government office,. This is disrespectful for an MLA. After the incident, Mevani filed a written application and called for a detailed investigation against the IPS. On the other hand, Home Secretary Manoj Das had said that he has not received any written application in this matter.

Before the modus operandi of making drugs under the guise of pharmaceutical companies, the only trend was smuggling drugs via Pakistan and Afghanistan in Gujarat.

The businessman had filed a writ petition against the police, alleging harassment over a demand to repay ₹21 lakh. He claimed that senior officers, including the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) and a police inspector (PI), had repeatedly contacted him, issuing threats and summons, asking for a repayment to a complainant. During the proceedings, Justice Sandip Bhatt criticised the police’s focus on the recovery of funds, questioning their work, such as traffic congestion on the Bavla-Changodar road. “What is going on? Are the police only interested in money recovery? There are a lot of traffic problems that need addressing in the city,” the Justice remarked. Justice Bhatt said that the situation was a business matter, and questioned why the police were interested so much in this matter. “Is this what police are meant for? This is too much,” he stated. Further criticising the police, the court observed that even though the role of police is to help people, these days, safety of women and ordinary citizens has become a concern. People are pulling out swords in small disputes, and police are misusing their powers. Rather than focusing on money recovery, police should control law and order situation in the state, said the Justice. The high court also demanded clarity on the basis of which the notice was issued in this civil dispute. The court has ordered top officials to provide detailed reports and explanations in the next hearing,  scheduled on October 25.

An official said that the accused had posed as a wealthy Sardar and defrauded a jeweller of 2,100 grams of gold biscuits by using fake currency notes featuring actor Anupam Kher’s photograph. “The incident took place at Lakshmi Jewels on CG Road, where the accused managed to deceive the jeweller and flee with the gold. Out of the stolen 2,100 grams of gold, 1,800 grams have been recovered,” the official said.

The Crime Branch also seized mobile phones and other materials during the operation. Additionally, four other suspects, including Bhupesh Surti from Mumbai and Vijay Bhura from Rajasthan, are still at large.

India’s first ice skating show takes-off in Ahmedabad,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/entertainment/indias-first-ice-skating-show-takes-off-in-ahmedabad,2024-10-18,18,10,2024,"India’s first international ice show will be held in Ahmedabad. A fully functional indoor ice skating rink has been created for this purpose at the EKA Arena, near Kankaria Lake. This temporary installation has been designed by the renowned Ice World team. The rink, measuring 20 by 40 metres, is a feat of engineering that brings a winter wonderland to life in the heart of India. The rink’s creation was achieved using advanced technology and energy-efficient systems. Aluminium channels, linked together with flowing glycol, help maintain the ice surface at a consistent temperature between -10°C and -12°C. This ensures a smooth, skate-ready surface suitable for figure skating and ice shows, even in the warm climate of Gujarat. The glycol system circulates beneath the surface, allowing the ice to freeze evenly and consistently across the 20x40 metre expanse. To achieve the perfect ice thickness of 6 to 7 cm, a layer of polystyrene (thermocol) has been laid at the base, providing both support and insulation. Water is carefully applied, levelled, and frozen to create a glass-like, smooth finish. It took just three days to complete the entire installation, with a dedicated team of 100 workers constantly maintaining the rink. Their efforts have ensured that the ice will be in prime condition for the ice show. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Gujarat Samachar English (@gujaratsamacharenglish) This high-tech ice rink is hosting the much-anticipated ‘Scheherazade – ICE Show’, a grand production brought to India by a team from Moscow. The show, created by Russian figure skating legend Tatiana Navka, is based on the famous Arabian folk tales of ‘1001 Nights’. Audiences will be transported into a magical world as the story of Persian king Shahryar and his wife Scheherazade unfolds through a mesmerising blend of music, dance, animation, and stunning feats of figure skating. The rink’s creation and the upcoming ice show mark a historic moment for India, where indoor ice skating facilities have been virtually non-existent. The Scheherazade ICE Show will feature performances by world-class athletes, including Olympic and World champions such as Tatiana Navka, Victoria Sinitsina, Nikita Katsalapov, Povilas Vanagas, Ivan Righini, and Egor Murashov. These stars will bring the fairy tale to life through elaborate costumes, graceful choreography, and breath-taking stunts on ice.",ahmedabad

The HC posed tough questions to the government. During the hearing, the additional advocate general provided information on the investigations and inquiries conducted since 2021. However, the high court expressed its displeasure regarding the progress of the case. Adopting a strict stance, HC questioned why despite the serious allegations involving molestation, a complaint was not filed against the MLA. Following the HC’s discontent, the advocate general assured FIR would be registered before the next hearing, on October 21. What was the case? This case dates back to November 2020 when an Ahmedabad-based woman and her daughter, were travelling in a car to Jaisalmer, along with Parmar and two others. During the journey, the minor was allegedly molested by Parmar and two other people present in the car near Abu. The mother of the minor who was allegedly molested by MLA Parmar attempted suicide at Rajasthan’s Jodhpur court premises on December 16, 2023. Later, on December 19, Rajasthan’s Jodhpur city police booked Parmar and another accused in the case, Mahesh Patel. The minor’s mother alleged that since the accused is a BJP MLA, he can influence the case through political pressure. She requested the court give directions for an impartial investigation.

On the occasion, people were served doodh-poha , which is a dessert of beaten rice soaked in saffron and cardamom-flavoured milk, and dry fruits. However, to the disappointment of the attendees, there were very few counters at the club serving the delicacy. Moreover, the dish had issues with quality and was found to be stale.

Baba Siddiqui murder: Why is Lawrence Bishnoi still in Sabarmati Central Jail?,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/why-is-lawrence-bishnoi-still-in-sabarmati-central-jail-after-baba-siddiqui,2024-10-18,18,10,2024,"It’s been over a week since the Lawrence Bishnoi gang claimed responsibility for the murder of Baba Siddiqui, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader who was shot dead in Mumbai on October 12. Yet, the Mumbai police have not sought custody of Bishnoi, raising questions about his continued incarceration in the Sabarmati Central Jail. Bishnoi’s gang has been implicated in several major crimes, including murders and drug-related offences. Reports suggest that Bishnoi has been running his criminal empire from behind bars. If true, they expose glaring holes in prison security and raise doubts about potential collusion at higher levels. The 31-year-old lawyer-turned-gangster is accused of at least 20 major crimes across several states, including Rajasthan, Punjab, and Maharashtra. He was arrested in August 2023 in connection with a drug case in Kutch. Thereafter, the Gujarat government applied Section 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), which restricts his transfer from Sabarmati jail. Given that he faces more cases outside Gujarat, the decision to keep Bishnoi in Gujarat is baffling at best and suspicious at worst. The government’s use of CrPC 268 to prevent his transfer — now extended until August 2025 — reeks of a calculated move. Some argue it’s for Bishnoi’s protection, to prevent him falling victim to an extrajudicial killing or “encounter.” The case has also gained international attention. The Canadian government has accused the Indian government of using the Bishnoi group to target the South Asian community in Canada – a claim that India has dismissed as “absurd”.

The parents of students of Kalorex Future School were summoned to the office of the district education officer (DEO) on Friday where they admitted fake admissions of their children. These students, studying in Class 1 to 6 will face cancellation of admissions at the end of the year. Every year, schools submit names of suspicious admissions under RTE to DEO. Last year, around 300 fake RTE admissions were witnessed in Ahmedabad. By the end of this year, over 50 students were under the radar of school administration over fake RTE admissions. The RTE provides free education for needy and underprivileged students from classes 1 to 8 in 13 categories, based on merit and income criteria. Many parents were found to be submitting false income certificates to get their children admitted under RTE. To address this issue, the government made it mandatory to attach income tax return proof along with the RTE form two years ago.

Vadaj tensions: Housing society terrorised amid ongoing feud,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/vadaj-tensions-housing-society-terrorised-amid-ongoing-feud,2024-10-19,19,10,2024,"Just days after unrest in Ahmedabad’s Amraiwadi, anti-social elements struck again — this time in Vadaj. On late night on Friday, a group of individuals, allegedly driven by personal enmity, barged into a housing society in Ram Colony, terrorising residents and damaging properties. The police have arrested two suspects, identified as Ranjeet Bharwad and Nirav Bharwad, in connection with the case. Authorities are continuing their investigation into the attack. According to police officials, the conflict stems from an incident that occurred about a month ago, on September 19. Kanu Bharwad, a resident of Vadaj, had lodged a complaint after being assaulted and humiliated by a group of 5-6 individuals from the Sardar community, who also reside in Ram Colony. The altercation marked the beginning of a tense standoff between the Bharwad and Sardar communities. For weeks, tensions simmered beneath the surface as Kanu Bharwad sought revenge for the earlier attack. On Friday, Kanu allegedly gathered a group of 15-20 people from his community and stormed Ram Colony, vandalising vehicles parked in the area. Approximately 15 vehicles, including cars, auto-rickshaws, and two-wheelers, were damaged during the attack. Residents who attempted to intervene were reportedly beaten by the group. The incident was quickly reported to the Vadaj Police Station, but by the time officers arrived, the attackers had fled. A case has been registered, and police are actively investigating the situation. Himanshu Kumar Verma, DCP Zone-1, provided further details, saying, “Over the past month, there has been tension building up, and the vandalism that took place last night was a result of personal enmity between individuals from the two communities. We have already arrested two suspects, and the search for others involved in the crime is ongoing.” Verma also reassured the public that security measures have been strengthened in the area. “We have deployed PCR vans and teams at the site to prevent any further incidents. A special team has been formed to apprehend the remaining culprits,” he added.",ahmedabad
Breast cancer awareness month: Over 54k diagnosed in Gujarat in 5 years,https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/breast-cancer-awareness-month-over-54k-diagnosed-in-gujarat-in-5-years,2024-10-19,19,10,2024,"October is recognised as ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’ as the World Health Organisation (WHO) dubs it ‘the most common cancer globally with around 2.3 million new cases every year’. Gujarat is witnessing a concerning rise in cancer cases along with heart disease as over the past five years, approximately 54,616 individuals have been diagnosed with breast cancer. In Gujarat, breast cancer deaths have increased by 25% in the past 10 years, with 3,355 deaths in 2014 compared to 4,280 in 2023. From 2014 to 2023, there have been 38,064 deaths related to breast cancer in Gujarat. Nationwide, the number of women dying from breast cancer increased from 78,387 in 2021 to 80,390 in 2022; and to 82,429 in 2023. Dr Shashank Pandya, Director of the Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI) located within Civil Hospital campus in Asarwa, stated, “Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Even today, most breast cancer cases in India are diagnosed in the last stage, leading to a higher death rate. Early diagnosis and timely treatment can significantly improve survival rates for breast cancer patients.” In a joint initiative by the government and the GCRI has launched a ‘Sanjeevani Rath’ screening van. This van travels across Gujarat to provide free cancer diagnosis services at various locations. The government has also started a special OPD (Outpatient Department) for breast cancer treatment at the Civil Cancer Hospital, where 60-70 patients are registered daily and receive free cancer screening services. Reasons behind increasing breast cancer cases The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Long-term use of hormones like estrogen and progesterone. Late marriages and late childbirth. Absence of breastfeeding. Alcohol, smoking, and obesity. Some breast cancers can be hereditary due to genetic mutations. 5-10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary, highlighting the importance of genetic screening. Steps to reduce breast cancer risk Self-examination of breasts every month after the fifth day of the menstrual cycle. Consulting medical practitioners and getting routine check-ups. Women aged 40 and above should get an annual mammogram (breast X-ray).
