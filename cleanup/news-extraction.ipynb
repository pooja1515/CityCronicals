      "Using AI technology, all signals will be connected to a central server. Under the ATCS, different systems such as vehicle detection sensors, intelligent and connected ATCS controllers, communication networks, and central servers will be integrated with real-time data on traffic conditions at the junctions, corridors, and areas.\n",
      "This will enable real-time monitoring of traffic conditions. A detailed project report is being prepared based on necessary surveys for implementing ATCS-based signal functions, and KPMG Advisory Services Pvt Ltd has been appointed as the consultant for this project.\n",

      "The efficiency of traffic signals will increase, and waiting time at signals will reduce.\n",
